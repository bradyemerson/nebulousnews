&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ended her visit to China on Sunday by attending services at a state-sanctioned church, having a conversation with women's rights activists and doing a brief Web chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events on the last day of her one-week Asian tour aimed to highlight Clinton's commitment to civil and religious rights in a way that would not offend the Chinese government, which resents what it views as interference in its internal affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every society has challenges and problems and issues and obstacles and it's important that people like all of you continue to raise those and speak out,&quot; Clinton said as she met about two dozen women's rights activists at the U.S. embassy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She warmly praised the activists, who included legal rights advocates, environmentalists and an 82-year-old doctor, Gao Yaojie, who exposed official complicity in the spread of AIDS in central China at unsanitary, often state-run clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Change really does come from individual decisions, many millions of individual decisions, where someone stands up like Dr. Gao and says 'No, I am not going to be quiet,'&quot; Clinton said. &quot;That's what we have to encourage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton made clear during her visit that while she would raise human rights in China she would not let U.S. concerns about them get in the way of joint work on the global economy, climate change and security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and the United States are both dependent on a revival of the U.S. economy and will rise or fall together, she told the Shanghai-based Dragon TV in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is the world's biggest holder of U.S. treasuries and Clinton said continuing to invest in them was &quot;a very smart decision.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;So by continuing to support American treasury instruments, the Chinese are recognizing our interconnection. We are truly going to rise or fall together. We are in the same boat and thankfully we are rowing in the same direction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHURCH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having visited Tokyo, Jakarta, Seoul and Beijing over the last week, Clinton began her day by attending a service at the Haidian Christian church, which was opened in Beijing's university district in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has about 40 million active Christians, and their numbers are evenly divided between state-run and underground churches, according to expert estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religious freedom is enshrined in China's constitution, but the government expects Christians to worship in &quot;patriotic&quot; churches under state control with clergy vetted by the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year a Christian activist was detained on his way to a service attended by U.S. President George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to protect the rights activists whom she later met at the U.S. embassy, U.S. officials asked reporters not to name those who did not wish their presence to be public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gao received an award in Washington two years ago after Clinton wrote to Chinese President Hu Jintao asking that he intervene with local officials who had sought to prevent the elderly doctor from traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am already 82. I am not going to live that much longer,&quot; Gao told Clinton. &quot;This is an important issue. I am not afraid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Blast in China coal mine kills 44, dozens trapped</title>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - A blast in a coal mine killed 44 miners in China's Shanxi province Sunday but hope grew for 96 others still trapped underground after some used mobile phones to contact their relatives, Xinhua news agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It said 436 miners were working underground when the accident occurred at Shanxi Jiaomei Group's Tunlan mine in Gujiao City near Taiyuan, the provincial capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xinhua said 114 miners were taken to hospital, where 44 died. A rescuer said some of the trapped miners had managed to phone their relatives. No other details were available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gas explosion happened the day after senior provincial officials held a conference about mine safety, in which they pledged to try to put an end to deadly mining accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China's mining industry is the world's most dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 3,786 coal miners died in gas blasts, floodings and other accidents in 2007 as companies, often flouting safety regulations, rushed to feed demand from a booming economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of deaths fell to 2,690 in the first 10 months of 2008 after thousands of small unsafe mines across the country were closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is continuing to push for the closure of small mines, many of which are struggling to remain open because demand from the electricity and steel sectors, their main customers, has slumped in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mine where Sunday's blast took place produces coking coal for the steel industry and can produce 5 million tonnes a year, Xinhua said.&lt;/p&gt;</media:text>

<title>Journal Register seeks bankruptcy protection</title>

<description><![CDATA[NEW YORK (Reuters) - Journal Register Co sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Saturday, making it the latest U.S. newspaper company to buckle under deteriorating advertising revenue and debt that it cannot easily repay.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51K20520090222</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Emily Chasan and Robert MacMillan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Journal Register Co sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Saturday, making it the latest U.S. newspaper company to buckle under deteriorating advertising revenue and debt that it cannot easily repay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company publishes 20 daily newspapers, including The New Haven Register and The Trentonian. It joins the ranks of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, as well as Tribune Co, publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, and highlights the challenges U.S. newspapers face as advertisers flee their print editions and more people get their news for free online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Journal Register has been among the smallest of publicly traded U.S. newspaper publishers. Nevertheless, its filing will increase scrutiny on other U.S. newspaper publishers, including McClatchy Co and Lee Enterprises, which are trying to survive a severe ad downturn without running afoul of their creditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journal Register has already agreed with key creditors on a pre-negotiated reorganization plan, and said it was planning to restructure its operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pre-negotiated bankruptcy allows companies to move more quickly through the court process because they have agreed on major issues with groups of creditors. The company plans to solicit votes quickly from other creditors on its bankruptcy reorganization plan, according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yardley, Pennsylvania-based company said advertising revenue had been driven lower by the housing downturn, declining automotive sales, the retail sector slowdown, a slow labor market that has hurt employment classifieds and a shift to online media, according to court papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journal Register's revenue declined by 2 percent in 2006, 8.5 percent in 2007 and was down 10 percent in the period from January 2008 through November 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has about $692 million of debt, it said in court papers. It listed assets of about $596 million and liabilities of about $737 million in court papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has about 3,465 employees and also owns 159 non-daily newspapers, it said in court papers. Under its proposed reorganization plan, the company said it planned to cancel its common stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journal Register is the leftover company from the former newspaper publishing empire owned by Ralph Ingersoll II in the 1980s. The company nearly went bankrupt late in that decade after bingeing on junk bonds to finance acquisitions and then being unable to pay its debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, it embarked on an ill-fated effort to start a rival daily paper to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which was then owned by Pulitzer Inc and now is part of Lee. The paper folded in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company had begun expanding earlier in the decade under late Chief Executive Robert Jelenic, who kept a close watch over expenses. According to some media reports, Jelenic personally took mileage readings on company cars to make sure his employees were not claiming too much money in expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the company spent $415 million to buy several papers in Michigan, only to see unemployment rise and the local economy fall apart. Many analysts in recent years said that would prove to be a huge mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon afterward, newspaper advertising revenue took a nosedive, leaving more publishers dangerously close to not being able to honor their debt terms. Journal Register eventually was delisted and began restructuring proceedings, including laying off employees and selling off papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has retained law firm Willkie, Farr &amp;amp; Gallagher LLP as legal counsel, Lazard Freres &amp;amp; Co as investment banker and Conway, Del Genio, Gries &amp;amp; Co as restructuring adviser, it said in court papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazard also is advising Tribune Co, which filed for bankruptcy after being unable to meet the terms of some $13 billion in debt it took on in a buyout led by real estate magnate Sam Zell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case is In re: Journal Register Co., U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-10769.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Clinton: diplomat, politician or advice columnist?</title>

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51L09A20090222</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Arshad Mohammed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton strolled past open-air sewers in Jakarta, talked robots over tea in Tokyo with the empress of Japan and met women students in Seoul, one of whom asked how she knew her husband &quot;would be your love&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know, I feel more like an advice columnist than a secretary of state today,&quot; a bemused Clinton replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making her first trip as the United States' top diplomat, Clinton made one thing abundantly clear during a week-long tour of Asian capitals: she is no ordinary secretary of state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where most of her pinstriped-predecessors have focused on policy, rather than people, the former presidential candidate took to diplomacy as if it was a political campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spliced in among her meetings with presidents and prime ministers, Clinton made time for an appearance on a music TV show in Indonesia, held &quot;town hall&quot; meetings with students in Japan and South Korea, and scheduled a web chat in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond advancing U.S. interests in Asia, Clinton told reporters she viewed part of her job as trying to restore an American image tarnished by the Iraq war and other unpopular policies pursued by former President George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've got a lot of work to do,&quot; she said early in her trip to Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and China. &quot;I have no illusions about how high ... a hill we have to climb here to inspire confidence and respect in people's minds again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former first lady tried to show that the United States can be a force for good in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, by taking a walk through a modest Jakarta neighborhood where Washington funds development projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the smell of open-air sewers in the air, Clinton took in small-scale projects to purify water, recycle trash into handicrafts and offer health care to mothers and babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This, to me, is what diplomacy is about,&quot; she later said. &quot;It doesn't just operate ... government to government. It operates people to people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROCK STAR RECEPTION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton generally got a rock star reception when she punched through the diplomatic bubble to meet ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Glorious to meet you,&quot; gushed a student at Japan's august Tokyo University, where Clinton talked about everything from baseball to her chat with the empress about whether Japanese robots may someday help the elderly to stay in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visiting Indonesia ahead of a presidential election this year, Clinton made a point about the necessity of accepting the outcome of a fair election, even when you lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've had that experience, and I know,&quot; she said with ironic understatement, alluding to her defeat by U.S. President Barack Obama in the race to be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and prompting a ripple of laughter and applause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton broke with diplomatic discretion at several points on her trip, openly talking about the possibility there could be a power struggle in Pyongyang over who may succeed North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western diplomats seldom, if ever, speak openly about a matter of such sensitivity, in part for fear of angering the mercurial leader of the Stalinist state, which tested a nuclear device in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's been in the news for months,&quot; Clinton said when asked about her comment. &quot;I don't think that it's a forbidden subject to talk about succession in the hermit kingdom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that it's worth being perhaps more straightforward and trying to engage other countries on the basis of the reality that exists,&quot; Clinton added. &quot;That's how I see it, and that's how I intend to operate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>&quot;The Wrestler&quot; wins big at Spirit Awards</title>

<description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - "The Wrestler" pummeled its opponents at the Spirit Awards on Saturday, winning three awards, including best feature at the independent film world's equivalent of the Oscars.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51L06020090222</guid>
<media:content url="http://www.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20090222&amp;t=2&amp;i=8355608&amp;w="  type="image/jpeg"  expression="full"  medium="image" ></media:content>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - &quot;The Wrestler&quot; pummeled its opponents at the Spirit Awards on Saturday, winning three awards, including best feature at the independent film world's equivalent of the Oscars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film's star, Mickey Rourke, won the male lead race for his comeback title role as a washed-up fighter. French camerawoman Maryse Alberti won the cinematography prize for her work on the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rourke, a Hollywood bad-boy whose career flat-lined years ago before his resurrection in &quot;The Wrestler,&quot; basked in the limelight as he received his award to a partial standing ovation underneath a marquee on Santa Monica beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After kissing the film's director, Darren Aronofsky, on the lips, the 56-year-old actor launched into a meandering speech in which he recalled being arrested by the local police a decade ago, urged Hollywood to give his friend Eric Roberts another shot, and fought back tears as he paid tribute to his recently deceased Chihuahua dog Loki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his part, Aronofsky told reporters backstage that he hoped to work with Rourke again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've been joking with him I'm going to wait five years 'til he screws it up again, and then come back and reinvent him,&quot; Aronofsky said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rourke and &quot;Milk&quot; star Sean Penn, an absentee Spirit nominee, are the front-runners to win the Academy Award on Sunday. Each year, a handful of Spirit winners usually go on to take home an Oscar, and Aronofsky diplomatically suggested the ideal solution would be a rare tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &quot;Frozen River&quot; star Melissa Leo, who won the female lead Spirit over fellow Oscar nominee Anne Hathaway (&quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot;), was in no doubt about her prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have no chance,&quot; Leo said, when asked about her Oscar prospects. &quot;Don't put your money on me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She suggested it would be a race between Meryl Streep for &quot;Doubt&quot; and Kate Winslet for &quot;The Reader.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other multiple Spirit winners included &quot;Milk,&quot; for James Franco's supporting turn as a gay lover of Penn's character and for rookie scribe Dustin Lance Black's first screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black told reporters that gay and lesbian people needed to reintroduce themselves to their communities to prevent electoral setbacks such as the recent California vote that blocked gay marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I do believe that America loves gay and lesbian people. They just might not have met us yet,&quot; Black said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black will also compete for an Oscar on Sunday, one of eight awards for which the film is in contention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm a dreamer so I think we're gonna do well,&quot; Black said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&quot; also won a pair of prizes, for director Woody Allen's screenplay and for Spanish actress Penelope Cruz's supporting role in the continental love-triangle romance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceremony's host, British comedian Steve Coogan, joked that a new category would be created in Allen's honor -- &quot;best girl-on-girl action described as art.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other categories, the best director prize went to Tom McCarthy for the illegal-immigrant saga &quot;The Visitor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentary award went to &quot;Man on Wire,&quot; which recounts Frenchman Philippe Petit's tight-rope trek between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know what would have made that film a little better for me,&quot; Coogan said to Petit. &quot;If you'd fallen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spirit Awards, now in their 24th year, honor low-budget American films based on such criteria as original, provocative subject matter and the degree of independent financing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. bank stress tests to show capital needs: source</title>

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51K1YC20090222</guid>
<media:content url="http://www.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20090222&amp;t=2&amp;i=8355574&amp;w="  type="image/jpeg"  expression="full"  medium="image" ></media:content>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By David Lawder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Financial regulators will soon launch a series of &quot;stress tests&quot; to determine which of the largest U.S. banks should get bigger capital cushions in case of a deeper recession, a person familiar with Obama administration plans said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person, speaking on condition of anonymity, said if institutions were found to need additional capital, financial authorities would provide them with an &quot;extra cushion of support.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks are expected to receive additional information about the tests in the coming week from regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. banks are &quot;well capitalized&quot; for current conditions, the source said, but the Obama administration wants to ensure they can withstand a more severe economic climate and play an important role in helping restart the flow of credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial plans for the stress tests were announced on February 10 as part of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's bank stabilization plan, but the source on Saturday for the first time linked the tests to additional government support for large banks. That person did not specify what form any extra capital cushion may take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the form of the stress tests, but the person described them as &quot;consistent, forward looking and conservative.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration tried on Friday to ease market fears the government was poised to nationalize some large banks that are struggling with losses and a lack of confidence, notably Citigroup and Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank shares fell sharply, with Citigroup plunging 22 percent to below the $2 fee of a typical automated teller machine, or ATM, and Bank of America trading around the $4 level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Friday, &quot;This administration continues to strongly believe that a privately held banking system is the correct way to go.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was quickly echoed by a statement from the U.S. Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INVESTORS LOSE CONFIDENCE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup and Bank of America have each received $45 billion in government capital in recent months and guarantees against losses on portfolios of illiquid mortgage assets -- aid that now exceeds their market value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With investors losing confidence in the sector as recessionary losses on real estate and commercial loans mount, analysts say the government may have to do more to prop up the largest banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than opting for a sweeping takeover, the government may act more incrementally, demanding a little more control every time Bank of America or Citigroup seeks more capital, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major interventions in financial institutions, such as Bear Stearns 11 months ago, American International Group in September and a second-round investment in Citigroup, occurred just after major drops in share prices made it clear they could not raise private capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government &quot;will try to do everything they can before they nationalize banks, but they may ultimately do it,&quot; said Lee Delaporte, director of research at Dreman Value Management, which has $10 billion under management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The bank stocks are telling you nationalization is going to happen,&quot; Delaporte added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the Treasury has put up about $235 billion for banks largely by purchasing only preferred shares to avoid diluting common shareholders. Under Geithner's revamp, those injections could come in the form of shares that could be converted to common equity if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of detail in Geithner's bank plan, particularly about a $500 billion to $1 trillion public-private fund to soak up toxic assets, has fueled investor concerns that bank takeovers could become an option. Geithner did not specify how much money would be earmarked for bank capital injections under the plan, which mapped out how the second $350 billion of the $700 billion bailout fund would be spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geithner has devoted $50 billion to modify troubled mortgages and $100 billion to support a $1 trillion Federal Reserve asset-backed securities lending facility aimed at unblocking frozen consumer credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers have pressed Geithner on whether and when he will return to seek more funding to shore up the banking system. Geithner told Congress on February 11 that as the &quot;design elements&quot; of his plan were fleshed out, he would have a better handle on the ultimate risks and costs for the program.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc Chief Executive Carol Bartz could announce a major management reorganization as early as next week, according to the blog AllThingsD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal-affiliated blog, citing several sources inside and outside the Internet company, said the revamp would likely come on Wednesday, although it could be pushed out a week or two or rolled out in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bartz sent a memo to employees on Friday in which she said, &quot;Get well-rested, because next week's a biggie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo officials declined to comment. A source at Yahoo, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue, said rumors of a reorganization were swirling within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, the leading provider of online display advertising, has been under pressure for nearly a year as it held fruitless merger or partnership talks with Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and Time Warner Inc's AOL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that time, Yahoo lost market share in search advertising, while display ad sales have been badly hit industrywide by the U.S. recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reorganization is expected to include a structure where executives like chief operating officer, chief technology officer and a new, more powerful chief marketing officer all report to Bartz, the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, several sources suggested Bartz may abandon a recent restructuring that split the world into four operating regions, the blog said. Instead, one executive could head the United States and a second head up all international efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By David Lawder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Financial regulators will soon launch a series of &quot;stress tests&quot; to determine which of the largest U.S. banks should get bigger capital cushions in the event of a deeper recession, a person familiar with Obama administration plans said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person, speaking on condition of anonymity, said if institutions are found to need additional capital, financial authorities will provide them with an &quot;extra cushion of support.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks are expected to receive additional information about the tests in the coming week from regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. banks are &quot;well capitalized&quot; for current conditions, the source said, but the Obama administration wants to ensure that they can withstand a more severe economic climate and can play an important role in maintaining the flow of credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial plans for the stress tests were announced February 10 as part of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's bank stabilization plan, but the source on Saturday for the first time linked the tests to additional government support for large banks. This person did not specify what form any extra capital cushion may take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the form of the stress tests, but the person described them as &quot;consistent, forward looking and conservative.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration on Friday tried to ease market fears that the government was poised to nationalize some large banks that are continuing to struggle with losses and a lack of confidence, notably Citigroup and Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank shares fell sharply, with Citigroup's plunging 22 percent to below the $2 price of a typical automated teller machine (ATM) fee and Bank of America trading around the $4 level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Friday that &quot;this administration continues to strongly believe that a privately held banking system is the correct way to go.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was quickly echoed by a similar statement from the U.S. Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama, who promised during his White House campaign to roll back tax cuts on people earning more than $250,000, also plans to boost tax collections from about 16 percent of the economy this year to 19 percent in 2013, the official said, confirming a Washington Post report on Obama's budget proposals for the 2010 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. governors unlikely to turn down stimulus funds</title>

<description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Even Republican governors who have said they will reject some of Washington's stimulus money will end up taking much of the funding, the leader of the National Governors' Association said on Saturday.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51K1XM20090221</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Lambert&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Even Republican governors who have said they will reject some of Washington's stimulus money will end up taking much of the funding, the leader of the National Governors' Association said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the end ... most of the governors will accept most of the money and use it for the benefit of their citizens,&quot; said Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, Edward Rendell, at the association's annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the four days since President Barack Obama signed the $787 billion economic recovery bill into law, providing increases in federal backing for states' social services, infrastructure and education funding, at least two Republican governors have said they may not take all of the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stimulus package won only three Republican votes in Congress, amid charges that it was filled with wasteful spending and its $282 billion in tax cuts were not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi's Republican Governor, Haley Barbour, told reporters at the meeting he would decline some $50 million in extra unemployment insurance funding, because it includes a condition for expanding the benefits to more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once the federal money is gone we would have to replace it with state money, which means we would have to raise the unemployment insurance tax on employers,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if governors turn down money, the economic recovery law includes a provision allowing state legislatures to override governors. Barbour added that &quot;100 percent of the governors are going to take some percentage of the funding.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who has often been mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate for the 2012 elections, said late Friday he too would not take Louisiana's portion of the unemployment money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Workforce Commission estimates that would total $32.8 million over three years, but once the stimulus plan ended the state would have to cover the benefits at roughly $12 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Maryland where unemployment has spiked in recent months, Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley said his state had no problem with the unemployment provisions in the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't believe they'll cause tax increases or spending increases,&quot; he said. &quot;We welcome the unemployment dollars.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WAITING FOR THE DOLLARS TO FLOW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governors will meet with Obama on Monday to discuss the economy. Many states have already coordinated with their transportation agencies to apply the roads funds the federal government will distribute within the next three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package includes $120 billion for public works projects including highway and rail projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all agree, though, the stimulus plan will not make up for budget shortfalls hitting a majority of states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is not a state in this union that is going to be able to use this stimulus money and wipe away all of the problems and all of the challenges that we face,&quot; Rendell said, adding that $1 billion in spending still had to be cut recently from Pennsylvania's budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, a Republican, said his state recently cut its transportation budget in order to preserve funding for education and other social services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now the stimulus money comes in and it basically allows us to backfill in many of these critical areas like public and higher education and healthcare,&quot; he said. &quot;So we can now take the transportation money that was taken off the table a couple of months ago back to where it was originally intended. Our transportation budget is going to be whole.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stanford projects in limbo on island of St. Croix</title>

<description><![CDATA[CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (Reuters) - From the top of Recovery Hill, thick brush gives way to views of St. Croix's northern coast and largest city, where waterfront cafes and bobbing sailboats line the aquamarine sea.]]></description>

&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (Reuters) - From the top of Recovery Hill, thick brush gives way to views of St. Croix's northern coast and largest city, where waterfront cafes and bobbing sailboats line the aquamarine sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to see why billionaire Allen Stanford chose to live here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas financier at the center of a multi-billion dollar U.S. fraud charge owns several residential tracts in this largely undeveloped area just outside Christiansted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few large homes along the hill's steep, winding path but one property stands out with its long palm tree-lined driveway beckoning from behind a mechanical black metal gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No house is visible from the road, but on Saturday the gate bore a sign from the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources saying that development on the site had been stopped &quot;due to environmental violations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A neighbor who said the property belongs to Stanford is worried that its owner's latest troubles may permanently kill off the project, along with other investments Stanford has on St. Croix, the largest of the three main U.S. Virgin Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;He came to the islands, bought property and employed people,&quot; said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now this has taken the wind out of our sails.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 58, has been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with fraudulently selling $8 billion in certificates of deposit with improbably high interest rates from his Stanford International Bank in Antigua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DANISH WEST INDIAN STYLE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the 84-square-mile (218-square-km) island, construction on Stanford's massive business complex, which was intended to serve as headquarters for support functions of his financial empire, also seems to be stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one edge of the 37-acre parcel on the southwest corner of the Henry E. Rohlsen International Airport, metal beams were stacked and a backhoe sat parked beside a field of swaying guinea grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desolation is a far cry from the optimism that pervaded the groundbreaking ceremony here a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is an exciting day for the Stanford Financial Group of companies,&quot; Allen Stanford had said at the time, according his company's glossy in-house magazine, The Stanford Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not only are we breaking ground on a facility that will house the top-tier team that makes up Stanford Financial Group Global Management but we are expanding our footprint in the Caribbean with a permanent business home in St. Croix.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans for the St. Croix campus next to the tarmac include 105,000 square feet of office space incorporating architural and design elements of St. Croix's &quot;Danish West Indian style&quot; -- a nod the territory's days as a Danish colony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in the plan is a conference center to accommodate more than 200 people, a 45,000-square foot aviation hangar and office, a food pavilion and lounge area for staff and guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford had also planned to establish on St. Croix the offices for his Stanford Twenty20 Cricket Tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHARING THE EXCITEMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John deJongh, governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, seemed to share Stanford's excitement, according to the Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I see the relationship between Stanford Financial and the U.S. Virgin Islands as positioning the territory to become a beacon of business opportunity and employment possibilities,&quot; he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being a tourist haven, St. Croix, with a population of about 60,000, is home to a Hovensa oil refinery and a rum distillery owned by U.S.-based Fortune Brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford promised more investment, and set up a Caribbean Investment Fund to &quot;select and invest in developments designed to protect and enhance the region's natural beauty, environment and ecology while providing permanent gainful employment for local residents,&quot; the Eagle said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the St. Croix Avis, a local newspaper, Stanford owns a lot of real estate in downtown Christiansted, where low-rise pastel buildings feature curved arches and tourist-friendly boutiques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, he seems to have kept a low profile during his frequent stays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was known to be &quot;friendly but cautious,&quot; according to a taxi driver who said he driven Stanford's associates but never the man himself. The driver declined to be identified by name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;To the best of my knowledge, Stanford is a very private guy who did not participate in the life of St. Croix but instead stayed inside his security shell,&quot; said Doug Dawson, who runs a bed and breakfast establishment on St. Croix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;People here did see and meet his employees, and his pilots stayed at my bed and breakfast whenever he was on the island. He was here a lot in the last few years,&quot; Dawson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People around here wonder if they will ever see him again.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>UK's Brown to visit Washington March 3: White House</title>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Ross Colvin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown will hold talks with President Barack Obama in Washington on March 3 on the global financial crisis and a comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan, the White House said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The United States and the United Kingdom share a special partnership, and the president looks forward to working closely with the prime minister to address common global challenges,&quot; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two leaders would discuss the G20 summit in London on April 2 and the upcoming NATO summit, in particular Obama's call for a new, comprehensive strategy in Afghanistan, where both countries' troops are part of a NATO-led force battling rising insurgent violence, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain supported the U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, despite strong domestic opposition to the wars. A staunch U.S. ally, Britain often refers to the so-called &quot;special relationship&quot; between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has 38,000 troops in Afghanistan and Obama has ordered 17,000 more sent there to tackle an intensifying insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain has about 8,000 troops based in Afghanistan as part of a NATO force. It is the second biggest foreign force in Afghanistan and Britain has supported American calls for other NATO allies to step up their contribution to operations there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain, which has lost 145 troops in Afghanistan since 2001, also has forces in Iraq and has admitted that the two operations together create a substantial strain on its military forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the visit followed news that the United States has agreed to release Binyam Mohamed, a British resident, held at the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, without charge for the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama last met Brown in London last year when he left the U.S. presidential campaign to tour several European capitals to show off his foreign policy credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown wants world leaders to agree a package of coordinated measures to support the flagging world economy and fix its financial system when they meet at the G20 London summit in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown argues the success of Britain's own efforts to boost its economy depends on measures implemented elsewhere and believes it is essential that countries work together because the problems they were face are global.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are concerns that countries will respond to the downturn with protectionist measures, which many say will hamper the global recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Renowned investor George Soros said on Friday the world financial system has effectively disintegrated, adding that there is yet no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soros said the turbulence is actually more severe than during the Great Depression, comparing the current situation to the demise of the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September marked a turning point in the functioning of the market system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We witnessed the collapse of the financial system,&quot; Soros said at a Columbia University dinner. &quot;It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His comments echoed those made earlier at the same conference by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman who is now a top adviser to President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volcker said industrial production around the world was declining even more rapidly than in the United States, which is itself under severe strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't remember any time, maybe even in the Great Depression, when things went down quite so fast, quite so uniformly around the world,&quot; Volcker said.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will use his first budget, due to be unveiled next week, to put the United States on track toward cutting its ballooning deficit in half by 2013, an administration official said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The deficit this administration inherited was $1.3 trillion or 9.2 percent of GDP. By 2013, the end of the president's first term, the budget cuts the deficit to $533 billion or 3.0 percent of GDP,&quot; said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most of the savings will come from winding down the war in Iraq, increased revenue from those making more than $250,000 a year, and savings from making government work more efficiently and eliminating programs that do not work,&quot; the official added.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington police expect to make an arrest soon in the 2001 murder of a former U.S. government intern, a case that helped end a California congressman's career, authorities said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The killing of 24-year-old Chandra Levy had been one of the U.S. capital's most sensational unsolved crimes. At first, it received worldwide attention, but interest faded after the September 11, 2001, attacks and after it became a cold case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Condit, a Democratic congressman from California who was married, came under scrutiny amid the media storm that followed the May 2001 disappearance of Levy, whose remains were later found in Washington's Rock Creek Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Condit had admitted having a &quot;close relationship&quot; with Levy but maintained he had nothing to do with her disappearance or death. He eventually lost the Democratic primary when he sought re-election and left office by 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the suspect as Ingmar Guandique, 27, a Salvadoran immigrant who is in prison. He has denied any involvement in Levy's disappearance and killing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guandique pleaded guilty to assault in 2002 in two cases involving attacks on women in Rock Creek Park in May and July 2001. He is serving a 10-year sentence at a federal prison in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police came under criticism for initially focusing on Condit rather than Guandique. The officials said his arrest and charges in the Levy case could occur next week.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Junaid Khan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MINGORA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan said on Saturday officials had agreed a &quot;permanent&quot; truce with Taliban fighters in the northwestern Swat valley, but a Taliban commander said its own ceasefire would be reviewed next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;They have made a commitment that they will observe a permanent ceasefire and we'll do the same,&quot; Syed Mohammad Javed, the Commissioner of Malakand, told reporters after meeting with elders in Swat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 1,200 people have been killed and between 250,000 and 500,000 people have fled the valley which lies within the Malakand division of North West Frontier Province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, Islamist militants called a 10-day ceasefire in the valley as a &quot;goodwill gesture&quot; toward the peace talks. It runs out on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We heard that the government announced a permanent ceasefire, but we have announced a 10-day ceasefire and we will consider an extension when it ends,&quot; Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah told illegal FM radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western governments, and many Pakistanis, have been alarmed by the government's offer to reinstate sharia law in Malakand if the Taliban agreed to peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They fear that a ceasefire could result in another sanctuary in Pakistan where al Qaeda and Taliban militants could move freely, and also worry that Taliban fighters elsewhere in the region will be encouraged by the government's move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fazlullah congratulated his men on what he said was the reintroduction of sharia (Islamic law) in Malakand. &quot;Your sacrifices have not gone to waste, but they have proved a success for Pakistan, particularly for Malakand,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government officials were not immediately available to comment on Fazlullah's statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javed said efforts were being made to persuade the Taliban to allow girls' schools to reopen. Militants had torched around 200 girls' schools in Swat in a campaign against female education. Boys' schools will reopen on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceasefire announcement came a day after Fazlullah met his father-in-law, Maulana Sufi Mohammad, a radical cleric freed by the government to negotiate peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IN PRINCIPLE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal was agreed in principle on Monday by the government for NWFP and Sufi Mohammad, who then carried back the proposals to Fazlullah. He is said to have forged links with other Pakistani jihadi groups and al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sufi Mohammad led a revolt in 1994 in an attempt to bring Islamic sharia law back to Swat, and went on to lead an army of thousands of tribesmen in a futile attempt to help Taliban and al Qaeda fighters hold off U.S.-led forces in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was arrested after his return to Pakistan and spent six years in jail before the government released him last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Holbrooke, special U.S. envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, expressed unease over developments in Swat on Thursday and said he had been told by President Asif Ali Zardari that the pact being negotiated with the Islamists was an &quot;interim arrangement&quot; to stabilize the Swat region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zardari will not sign off on the re-introduction of Islamic law in Malakand unless peace is assured, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holbrooke visited Pakistan last week on his first tour of the region since being appointed by U.S. President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said U.S. officials had urged Paksitan to exert more force in Swat, rather than negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the army is fighting Taliban insurgencies elsewhere in the northwest, notably the tribal regions of Bajaur and Mohmand, and wants to be supplied with counter-insurgency equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Venus beats Razzano in Dubai to win 40th title</title>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Barry Wood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) - Venus Williams won her 40th singles title on Saturday by defeating unseeded Virginie Razzano 6-4 6-2 to win the Dubai Championships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the 28-year-old American's seventh triumph in her last eight finals, with her last title coming at the WTA Championships in Doha in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've had a lot of struggles at this event,&quot; Williams, who had never advanced beyond the semi-finals in three previous appearances, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not been the best tournament for me, so I definitely feel like, yeah, I'm on the victory stand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening set was closely contested, with her serve giving Williams the edge at the beginning although that was eventually dissolved by the quality of Razzano's returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Razzano was able to return the ball in play, the Frenchwoman rallied on equal terms with her opponent and Williams had to fight off three break points to hold for 3-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Williams leading 4-3, Razzano, who was playing in her first final since she defeated Williams in the Japan Open in 2007, received treatment to her lower back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams then broke in the final game of the set, earning set point with a fine crosscourt backhand winner before Razzano netted a forehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 25-year-old Razzano struggling with her serve in the second set, Williams surged to a 5-0 lead before the Frenchwoman offered some late resistance and Williams uncharacteristically showed signs of nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After failing to convert two match points on Razzano's serve at 5-1, Williams double-faulted twice as she dropped the seventh game but she finally closed out the match on her fourth match point when Razzano netted a forehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POLITICAL STORM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the future of the tournament having been in doubt after Israeli Shahar Peer was refused a visa by the United Arab Emirates, Williams said she would be happy to return next year to defend her title now the issue seemed to have been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel good about coming back here next year because having tournaments like this is a victory for women's tennis. It's a large event and we're stepping forward and I feel confident that everyone will have the opportunity to play next year,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;And if for some reason that wasn't the case then we would re-evaluate. But I think everyone's had the opportunity to do the right thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE defused a political storm on Thursday after being forced to change its policy of barring Israeli athletes from competing in the Gulf state. Like most Arab countries, the UAE has no diplomatic ties with Israel and routinely denies entry to its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women's Tennis Association (WTA) chief Larry Scott said he had been assured all Israeli athletes would get &quot;a special permit&quot; from the UAE government to enter the country if they had qualified for a tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to her good run in Dubai which featured victories over three seeds, including second-ranked Dinara Safina and number five Vera Zvonareva, Razzano is projected to rise from 58th in the world into the top 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This week is the best week of my career,&quot; Razzano told reporters. &quot;I think I played well again. I felt a good connection with the crowd. The crowd warmed to me and it was great.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - The mother of John Solecki, an American taken hostage in Pakistan while working for a U.N. agency for refugees, appealed on Saturday for her son's release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to be with John again,&quot; Rose Solecki said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We cannot bear the shock of losing John,&quot; she said on an audiotape released by the U.N. High Commission for Refugees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(UNHCR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solecki, head of the UNHCR in southwest Baluchistan province, was abducted on February 2 by gunmen who ambushed his car and shot dead his driver in the provincial capital, Quetta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unheard of militant group called the Baluchistan Liberation United Front (BLUF) has claimed responsibility and threatened to kill Solecki unless the United Nations acts on its demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BLUF wants the United Nations to secure the release of 141 women it says have been detained in Pakistan, provide information about more than 6,000 missing persons, and resolve the issue of Baluch independence under the Geneva Convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group extended a deadline on Monday for &quot;more days&quot; in order to give the United Nations extra time to meet its demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the death threat hanging over Solecki, the United Nations fears his life could be at risk because of deteriorating health. Solecki had complained of sickness in a videotape released by his captors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm appealing to the people of Baluchistan for whatever support they can provide to secure my son safety and freedom,&quot; said his 83-year old mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;John has helped many people in Baluchistan and now my son needs your help,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations has sought direct contact with the group holdings Solecki, without success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baluchistan, the largest but poorest of Pakistan's four provinces, lies on the border with Afghanistan. Separatist militants have fought a low-scale insurgency there for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51K1GF20090221</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Taliban fighters have agreed a &quot;permanent ceasefire&quot; in Pakistan's northwestern Swat valley, a senior government official said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made one day after Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah held talks with his father-in-law, Maulana Sufi Mohammad, a radical Muslim cleric freed by the government to negotiate peace in the valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some facts about the Taliban insurgency there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Islamist militancy emerged in Swat, an alpine beauty spot, in the 1990s when Maulana Sufi Mohammad took up arms to impose sharia law in Swat and neighbouring areas of Malakand, Dir as well as in the Bajaur tribal region on the Afghan border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Mohammad was arrested after he returned to Pakistan having led thousands of fighters to Afghanistan in 2001 in a vain attempt to help the Taliban resist U.S.-backed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Pakistani authorities released him in 2008 in a bid to defuse another uprising that broke out in late 2007, this time led by his son-in-law Maulana Fazlullah, who has ties with other Pakistani Taliban factions and al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Fazlullah called his men to arms after a military assault began on the Red Mosque in Islamabad in mid-2007 to put down a armed movement that was seeking to impose Islamic law in the capital. Fazlullah used illegal FM radio to propagate his message and became known as Mullah Radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* The Pakistan Army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power a year ago and tried to reach a negotiated settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* A peace accord fell apart in May. Since then hundreds of people, including soldiers, militants and civilians have been killed in battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They have banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Around 1,200 people have been killed since late 2007 and between 250,000 and 500,000 people have fled the valley, leaving the militants in virtual control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in Swat valley and neighbouring areas of the northwest in a bid to take the steam out of the Taliban insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Under Nizam-e-Adl or Islamic system of justice, all judicial laws contrary to Islamic teachings stand canceled and the courts will decide cases in line with Islamic injunctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Unlike the Taliban courts, which have been summarily handing out severe punishments like chopping off hands of thieves and stoning to death adulterers and rapists, there will be a system of appeal on the decisions handed out by courts in Swat and neighbouring districts. Ordinary judges, with a knowledge of Islam, will officiate and analysts said the courts are unlikely to hand down Taliban-like sentences.&lt;/p&gt;</media:text>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc Chief Executive Carol Bartz could announce a major management reorganization as early as next week, most likely on Wednesday, according to the blog AllThingsD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal-affiliated blog, citing several sources inside and outside the Internet company, said the shift could be pushed out a week or two or rolled out in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog cited a February 20 Bartz memo to employees, in which she said, &quot;Get well-rested, because next week's a biggie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo officials declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, the leading provider of online display advertising, has been under pressure for nearly a year as it held fruitless merger or partnership talks with Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and Time Warner Inc's AOL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that time, Yahoo lost market share in search advertising, while display ad sales have been badly hit industrywide by the U.S. recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reorganization is expected to include a set-up where executives like chief operating officer, chief technology officer and a new, more powerful chief marketing officer all report to Bartz, the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, several sources suggested Bartz may abandon a recent restructuring that split the world into four operating regions, the blog said. Instead, one executive could head the United States and a second head up all international efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51G5X720090221</guid>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Ross Colvin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama wants to slash the ballooning deficit in half by 2013, U.S. officials said on Saturday, after massively increasing public spending to stem the worst economic crisis in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama will outline his ambitious goal when he hosts a summit at the White House on Monday on fiscal responsibility and later in the week when his administration presents a summary of its first budget, for the 2010 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs in the midst of a global economic meltdown, Obama has said fixing the U.S. economy is his top priority. He has acknowledged that his success or failure in that will define his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can't generate sustained growth without getting our deficits under control,&quot; Obama said in his weekly radio address in which he also announced immediate implementation of tax cuts for 95 percent of Americans as part of the effort to stimulate the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An administration official said Obama was proposing to cut the deficit, which private economists project will rise to $1.5 trillion this year, through a mixture of tax increases on wealthier Americans and spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The deficit this administration inherited was $1.3 trillion or 9.2 percent of GDP. By 2013, the end of the president's first term, the budget cuts the deficit to $533 billion or 3.0 percent of GDP,&quot; the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most of the savings will come from winding down the war in Iraq, increased (tax) revenue from those making more than $250,000 a year, and savings from making government work more efficiently and eliminating programs that do not work,&quot; the official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent about $190 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2008. Obama has pledged to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months while ramping up the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since being sworn into office on January 20, Obama has sought to reassure Americans that his government is tackling the economic crisis boldly and swiftly -- holding near-daily events to announce measures to stem mortgage foreclosures, prop up failing banks, rescue the ailing auto industry and drive his stimulus package through Democratic-led Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures have received a mixed early reaction from gloomy financial markets uncertain whether they will succeed in arresting the downward economic spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUSH TAX CUTS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second administration official confirmed a Washington Post story that said Obama would propose boosting tax collection from about 16 percent of the economy this year to 19 percent in 2013, while federal spending would drop from about 26 percent of the economy to 22 percent in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said Obama would let tax cuts implemented by his predecessor George W. Bush for Americans earning more than $250,000 expire on schedule at the end of 2010, when the tax rate would rise from 35 percent to more than 39 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama told Americans in his radio address it was vital to get &quot;exploding deficits under control as our country begins to recover.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;On Thursday I'll release a budget that's sober in its assessments, honest in its accounting, and lays out in detail my strategy for investing in what we need, cutting what we don't and restoring fiscal discipline,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama has invited business and union leaders, academics and lawmakers to a summit on Monday to discuss ways of cutting the deficit. That will be followed by an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday in which he said he would outline &quot;our urgent national priorities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early January, just a few weeks before Obama took office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the budget deficit would soar to $1.2 trillion for the current 2009 fiscal year that ends September 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that figure excluded the recently passed $787 billion stimulus package, a combination of tax cuts and spending on infrastructure projects over more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private analysts expect the impact of the stimulus package and other spending to counter the economic downturn will push the deficit to $1.5 trillion or more this year. That would be more than triple the $455 billion deficit recorded in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over time, the budget deficit will make it harder for our economy to grow and create jobs. That's why the president's budget for FY (fiscal year) 2010 puts us on the path to cut the deficit he inherited on January 20, 2009, in half by the end of his first term,&quot; an administration official told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Saturday, Obama said the U.S. Treasury will implement tax cuts for 95 percent of Americans enacted as part of the $897 billion stimulus package, fulfilling a campaign pledge he hopes will help jolt the economy out of recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm pleased to announce that this morning the Treasury Department began directing employers to reduce the amount of taxes withheld from paychecks, meaning that by April 1st, a typical family will begin taking home at least $65 more every month,&quot; Obama said.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it strongly believed in a privately held bank system, after rumors that the U.S. government could nationalize banks caused shares in Bank of America and Citigroup plummet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let me reassure as best I can on banks,&quot; White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told a briefing with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This administration continues to strongly believe that a privately held banking system is the correct way to go, ensuring they are regulated sufficiently by this government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's been our belief for quite some time and we continue to have that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House spokesman's comments helped lift U.S. stocks from their lows of the day, traders said. The Nasdaq Composite index briefly turned positive, and the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index both cut deep losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. government debt prices cut their gains as the move up in equities diminished their safe-haven appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the briefing, Gibbs was pressed further on whether his comments meant the Obama administration would never nationalize the banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think I was very clear about the system that this country has and will continue to have,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</media:text>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Treasury Department late Friday sought to shoot down persistent rumors Citibank and Bank of America are about to become wholly owned subsidiaries of Uncle Sam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are a lot of rumors in the market, as always, but you should not regard these as any indication of the policy of this administration. As Secretary (Timothy) Geithner has said, we will preserve a financial system that is owned and managed by the private sector,&quot; Treasury spokesman Isaac Baker said in a prepared statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement followed comments from White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who told reporters earlier in the day that President Barack Obama continues to believe &quot;a privately held banking system is the correct way to go.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea kept up its tough rhetoric against the United States and South Korea on Saturday, accusing Washington of preparing for war on the Korean peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also continued to target South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, calling him a traitor, a day after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that ties with Pyongyang could not improve if it continued insulting South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea's official media, however was silent on Clinton's remarks over the leadership issue in Pyongyang and the possibility of a crisis over who may succeed leader Kim Jong-il, 67, who is widely believed to have suffered a stroke last August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the U.S. war-thirsty forces are allowed to continue frantically stepping up the moves for another Korean war ... the situation on the Korean Peninsula will reach an unpredictable phase and the U.S. will be held wholly accountable for the ensuing consequences,&quot; the North's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton on Friday called the North a &quot;tyranny&quot; and demanded it stop insulting the leaders in the South if it wanted a normal relationship with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But North Korea's agency that handles dealings with the South said Lee had insulted the socialist state ideology of the North and erased all chances of improving ties between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will settle scores with the traitor with the most merciless and resolute determination,&quot; the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has issued increasingly furious rhetoric against the South in anger over conservative policy to get tough with Pyongyang and stop the no-questions-asked aid given by his liberal predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton said on Thursday questions about the North's leadership succession created uncertainty and possibly encourage provocative behavior inside the communist state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has been thought to be readying its longest-range missile for launch in what analysts said is a bid to grab the new U.S. administration's attention and put pressure on Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton was in Beijing on Saturday on the final leg of her tour which also took her to Japan, South Korea and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:content url="http://www.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20090221&amp;t=2&amp;i=8351980&amp;w="  type="image/jpeg"  expression="full"  medium="image" ></media:content>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Gov. David Paterson has acknowledged ordering his staff to deny that Caroline Kennedy had been his first choice following her withdrawal from consideration to replace Hillary Clinton as senator, The New York Times reported on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in his first admission to any role in the matter of how Kennedy's withdrawal was portrayed, Paterson told the paper in a telephone interview he had never intended anything on the order of what he termed &quot;character assassination.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paterson said in the interview on Friday that he was bewildered when members of his staff harshly attacked Kennedy, who was considered a strong candidate to replace Clinton, the then secretary of state nominee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, Paterson said he meant for them to challenge the Kennedy camp position that she had been his first choice for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The things said about Caroline I found despicable and shocking and very painful,&quot; the Times quoted Paterson as saying. &quot;I never would have imagined removing the idea that this is my first choice meant a character assassination,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paterson, whose job approval rating has suffered in recent weeks, was criticized for his handling of the Kennedy withdrawal , a development that embarrassed Paterson and set off fears in his inner circle that anyone he then selected would look like a second choice, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy withdrew her name from consideration shortly after midnight January 22, citing personal reasons. But later that day people in the governor's administration told reporters that tax problems and issues with a domestic worker had emerged, helping scuttle her candidacy -- claims now broadly acknowledged to have been distorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let's try to point out that we're not indicating that anybody is the No. 1,&quot; Paterson recounted having told his staff. &quot;How that turned into what happened is something I have to take responsibility for,&quot; he told the Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paterson did not address whether he had apologized or spoken to Kennedy in the interim. &quot;I'd rather not go into my private communications with her,&quot; the newspaper quoted him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governor also confirmed that his top communications strategist no longer worked for him.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FACTBOX: Clinton's track record on China human rights</title>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a  long-time critic of China's human rights record, made clear on Saturday that working with Beijing to promote economic recovery was Washington's top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to her appointment as secretary of state, Clinton had irked China by criticizing the country's human rights record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton said the Obama Administration would press China on human rights but said this would not &quot;interfere&quot; with their work on the financial crisis, climate change and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is a list of some of her past comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Clinton criticized Chinese policy in 1995 at a U.N. conference in Beijing without citing China by name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;(Freedom) means not taking citizens away from their loved ones and jailing them, mistreating them, or denying them their freedom or dignity because of the peaceful expression of their ideas and opinions,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is a violation of human rights when women are denied the right to plan their own families, and that includes being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will,&quot; she said. Under Chinese law, most couples are restricted to one child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Clinton angered China last year with calls for a strong U.S. stance on religious freedom in Tibet after protests against Chinese rule there escalated into riots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we should be speaking out through our administration now in a much more forceful way and, you know, supporting people in Tibet who are trying to preserve their culture and their religion from tremendous pressure by the Chinese,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Clinton urged President George W. Bush to boycott the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics unless China improved human rights. She cited violent clashes in Tibet and the lack of pressure by China on Sudan to stop &quot;the genocide in Darfur.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Clinton said she would not shy away from human rights issues during her trip this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said in a speech that Washington should work to create a world that respects human rights and where &quot;all Chinese people can enjoy religious freedom without fear of prosecution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International rights groups urged Clinton to speak out about suspected torture in police custody, censorship and abuses of human rights defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stanford's charges could derail $1 billion Caribbean project</title>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jason Szep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CRABS PENINSULA, Antigua (Reuters) - The tranquil, reef-fringed isle off Antigua's north coast sustains mangroves, deer and a rare duck species -- along with ambitions for one of the Caribbean's biggest development projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. investigation into Texas billionaire Allen Stanford and his Antiguan-based bank could deal a fatal blow to the estimated $1 billion plan that has dangled near death several times since surfacing in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford, a 58-year-old financier and sports tycoon with a knighthood bestowed by the tiny Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda, faces fraud charges centered around $8 billion managed by his Antiguan affiliate, Stanford International Bank Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The probe casts into uncertainty his investments and projects stretching from Texas to Latin America and the Caribbean, including a long-sought bid to turn ecologically sensitive Guiana Island into a playground for the ultra-rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guiana is Antigua's largest offshore island and one of the most pristine and ecologically important tracts of land in a country already bestowed with some of the world's finest beaches. At 8 sq km (5 sq miles), it's almost two percent of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stanford had a number of projects that he's been trying to get through the regulatory process, and that was clearly the biggest,&quot; Winston Derrick, publisher of the island's Daily Observer newspaper, said in an interview. &quot;He has been trying to get a commitment out of the government to do this project.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home to the endangered West Indian Whistling duck, the island of cactus, thorn bush, mangrove and rocks has a colorful, if chequered, history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until 1997, its only inhabitants were a Welsh couple -- Taffy and Bonnie Bufton, who lived off rainwater filtered through rocks, a flock of sheep and fallow deer for about 30 years, rebuffing the government's offer of $500,000 to sell the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The isolation ended when Taffy Bufton shot and wounded the brother of then-Prime Minister Lester Bird in a land dispute in December 1997. They were promptly removed by the government, clearing the way for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bird sold the land a year later to Malaysian entrepreneur Tan Kay Hock for about $5 million to build an ambitious &quot;Asian Village&quot; of luxury Asian-style hotels, a casino, marinas, a golf course, a shopping center and a conference facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the 1998 Asian financial crisis intervened. Tan only produced about $1 million and failed to develop the land, Antiguan officials say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENTER THE TEXAN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bird turned to his close ally, Antigua's most famous Texan, who agreed to transform the island into a luxury resort region studded with multimillion dollar homes, a mega-yacht marina, an 18-hole golf course and exclusive restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he didn't get far. Bird's Antigua Labor Party lost power in 2004 and the United Progressive Party (UPP) swept elections with a manifesto that included opposition to the Guiana Island Development Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a year, the UPP shifted gears, giving a green light to Stanford to buy the land for around $20 million, saying the economic benefits -- including nearly 2,000 jobs over the first three years -- justified the switch. The agreement, involving transferring the deed from Tan, didn't last long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brash American soon ran afoul of Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer in a series of missteps in 2006 and 2007 that began with a visit to the leader's hometown and chief political constituency, Gray's Farm -- a poor, crime-infested area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joined by an opposition politician, Stanford held a news conference expressing shock at the area's poverty and proposed using his own money to spruce it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antigua's prime minister accused Stanford of meddling in Antiguan politics, blasting the American as &quot;haughty, arrogant and obnoxious.&quot; The green light to develop Guiana Island, he said, had turned red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A later apology from Stanford failed to mend fences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 20 years in Antigua where he acquired citizenship, Stanford appeared to have lost the ear of the government and moved his primary home to St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and put in place plans for a regional headquarters there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the U.S. charges, most believed Stanford was biding time ahead of general elections scheduled for March 12. A win by Stanford's old political allies, the Labor Party, was widely expected to revive his plans for Guiana Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was before Tuesday when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Stanford, two colleagues and three of his companies with &quot;massive, ongoing fraud.&quot; Some Antiguans now question whether the project go forward without Stanford's financial and political muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; said Eli Fuller, who runs eco-tourism company Adventure Antigua and has led opposition to the project for years. &quot;Before the charges, the project was on hold pending the outcome of the election in March. But given what's happened, that's all changing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. sticks with Bush position on Bagram detainees</title>

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51K0MF20090221</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday told a federal judge it would not deviate from the Bush administration's position that detainees held at a U.S. air base in Afghanistan have no right to sue in U.S. courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of his first acts in office, President Barack Obama ordered the closure within one year of the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which has been widely criticized by rights groups and foreign governments. About 245 people are currently held at Guantanamo, according to the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Obama has not yet decided what to do about the makeshift prison at the U.S. military base in Bagram, where the U.S. government is holding more than 600 prisoners, or whether to continue work on a $60 million prison complex there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late January, Obama directed a task force to study the government's overall detainee policy and report back to him in six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the new administration faced a February 20 deadline to tell U.S. District Court Judge John Bates whether it would &quot;refine&quot; the Bush administration's position on four men being held at Bagram who have filed suit against their detention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a brief filing with the court on Friday, the Justice Department said it would stick to the previous government's position, which argued the four men -- who have been detained at Bagram for over six years -- had no right to challenge their detention in a U.S. court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Olshansky, lead counsel for three of the four detainees and a visiting professor at Stanford Law School, said she was deeply disappointed that the Obama administration had decided to &quot;adhere to a position that has contributed to making our country a pariah around the world for its flagrant disregard of people's human rights.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she hoped that the Obama administration was merely signaling it was still working on its position regarding the detainee issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. District Court held a hearing in early January on four separate challenges filed on behalf of four detainees taken to Bagram from outside Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the hearing, Bush administration lawyers argued that Bagram detainees were different from those held at Guantanamo, and could pose a security threat if released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Obama's executive order indicating changes to the government's detention policy for Guantanamo, the district court asked the new administration if it wished to change its position on the prisoners at Bagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the government has responded, the federal judge is expected to rule in coming weeks on whether his court has jurisdiction to hear the cases.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Arshad Mohammed and Benjamin Kang Lim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Saturday the United States and China can help pull the world out of economic crisis by working together and made clear this took precedence over U.S. concerns about human rights in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making her first visit to China as secretary of state, Clinton took a softer line on Chinese political and religious freedoms than in a 1995 Beijing speech in which she openly criticized the Chinese government's human rights record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a news conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, Clinton said the two would have &quot;frank discussions on issues where we have disagreements, including human rights, Tibet, religious freedom and freedom of expression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, she suggested their joint efforts to spur growth in the face of the global financial crisis, to curb global climate change and to address security challenges like North Korea's nuclear weapons program came first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;World events have given us a full and formidable agenda,&quot; she said, saying she and Yang had wide-ranging talks &quot;that started from a simple premise: it is essential that the United States and China have a positive, cooperative relationship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making her final stop on a one-week Asian trip that has also taken her to Tokyo, Jakarta and Seoul, Clinton stressed how intertwined are the U.S. and Chinese economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is one of the largest buyers of Chinese exports while China, with foreign exchange reserves of about $2 trillion, is the world's largest holder of U.S. government debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I appreciate greatly the Chinese government's continuing confidence in United States Treasuries. I think that's a well grounded confidence,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;We have every reason to believe that the United States and China will recover and that together we will help to lead the world recovery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if China might someday rethink its purchases of U.S. Treasuries, Yang provided little direction, saying only that China makes decisions on how to invest its foreign exchange reserves so as to ensure their safety, value and liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISSIDENTS BARRED FROM LEAVING HOMES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the U.S. desire for China to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Clinton visited a low-emissions heat and power plant that runs with generators from General Electric Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The United States, and certainly the Obama administration, we want China to grow,&quot; she said after touring the plant. &quot;What we hope is that you won't make the same mistakes we made ... When we were industrializing ... we didn't know any better.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and the United States are the world's leading emitters of greenhouse gases and their reaching an accord on limiting emissions is regarded as essential for a global deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton met President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao and, before leaving on Sunday, was to attend church and meet &quot;civil society&quot; activists, gestures designed to show interest in political and religious freedom without causing offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a markedly different stance from her 1995 Beijing speech, Clinton on Friday said Washington would press China on human rights but said this would not &quot;interfere&quot; with their work on the financial crisis, climate change and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human rights groups argued that Clinton's position undermined U.S. leverage with China on rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Secretary Clinton's remarks point to a diplomatic strategy that has worked well for the Chinese government -- segregating human rights issues into a dead-end dialogue of the deaf,&quot; Sophie Richardson, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Chinese dissidents, some of them signatories of a petition called &quot;Charter 08&quot; that demands democratic political reform, have been barred from leaving their homes, the Chinese Human Rights Defenders said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because of Hillary's China visit, police are standing guard outside my home. I need their permission to go out tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,&quot; dissident writer Yu Jie wrote in a cell phone text message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Charter 08 petition, issued in December, has pitted hundreds of dissidents and civil rights campaigners against the Communist Party. One of its organizers, Liu Xiaobo, has been taken into custody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeating a long-standing Chinese position, Yang said China was willing to talk to the United States about human rights on the basis of &quot;non-interference&quot; in each other's internal affairs. He also suggested U.S. concerns were misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Though these days it's a bit chilly in Beijing ... I have confidence that you will see the biggest number of smiling faces here in China,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Caren Bohan and Lisa Lambert&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama vowed strict oversight Friday of his $787 billion stimulus plan, pushing back against Republicans who have labeled the centerpiece of his economic agenda fiscally irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama said he would name a team of managers to ensure that billions of dollars slated for infrastructure projects would be spent wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The American people are watching. They need this plan to work,&quot; Obama said at a gathering at the White House with dozens of the nation's mayors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;And they expect to see the money they worked so hard to earn spent in its intended purpose without waste, inefficiency, or fraud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking office last month amid a deepening recession, Obama made his top priority the passage of the stimulus plan. He said the measure was crucial to jump-start growth and prevent the unemployment rate from surging into double digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signing this week of the bill -- the most expensive in history -- marked a big victory for Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Republicans, most of whom refused to support the stimulus plan, criticized the bill as laden with wasteful spending and said it would do little to revive the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama and other Democrats have bristled at Republican attempts to characterize their plans as fiscally irresponsible. They note the federal budget shifted from surplus to huge deficits during Republican President George W. Bush's administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republicans controlled Congress during much of the Bush administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the infrastructure spending, the bill includes tax cuts and spending to bolster social safety net programs like unemployment insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event with the mayors, Obama said the stimulus plan would not only create jobs but put the economy on a sounder footing in the long term through spending on infrastructure such as roads and bridges, mass transit and the expansion of broadband networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TARGETING WASTE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also emphasized his intent to prevent any wasteful uses of the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;If a federal agency proposes a project that will waste that money, I will not hesitate to call them out on it, and put a stop to it,&quot; Obama said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want everyone here to be on notice that if a local government does the same, I will call them out on it as well, and use the full power of my office and our administration to stop it,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After asking for economic help from the federal government for more than a year, mayors of both political parties are among the strongest supporters of Obama's stimulus package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several mayors who attended the event told reporters later they supported Obama's call for accountability, not only for the federal government but for cities as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don't mind getting called out. ... We welcome that kind of accountability. We're going to help get the job done,&quot; said Trenton, New Jersey, Mayor Douglas Palmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama's pledge to spend the stimulus money efficiently came before events planned next week in which he and his aides will emphasize their commitment to rein in the budget deficit, which private economists say will likely balloon to about $1.5 trillion this year. That figure includes the $700 billion from the bank rescue plan but not the stimulus plan signed by Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deficit in the previous fiscal year was a record-high $455 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday, Obama is hosting lawmakers, economists and representatives of business and labor groups at the White House for a &quot;Fiscal Responsibility Summit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House is expected to unveil its budget proposal Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some fiscal issues will also likely be highlighted in an address Obama will deliver to Congress Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the fiscal summit, which will be attended by top Democrats as well as leading Republicans, Obama is expected to underscore his commitment to tackle long-term budget challenges, such as the cost of health and retirement entitlement programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The president felt that we have to start doing this now. For too long, there has been an irresponsibility among people in the Beltway who were unwilling to make the tough choices,&quot; said Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for the White House budget office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This will be the beginning of that process,&quot; Baer said.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama has barely had a chance to draw breath since being sworn into office a month ago as he pushes his administration's efforts to arrest a spiraling economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he is not meeting chief executives, mayors or state governors, he is holding near daily public events to sell his $787 billion economic recovery package to rescue the United States from the worst economic crisis in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His schedule next week shows no let-up, with a fiscal summit, major speech to Congress, budget unveiling and a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso all penned in his diary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some details of the events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MONDAY: FISCAL SUMMIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will host a &quot;Fiscal Responsibility Summit&quot; at the White House, starting at 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), to which about 130 people have been invited, including lawmakers, academics and business leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White House spokesman Robert Gibbs described the summit as &quot;a frank discussion&quot; on reducing the deficit and getting the country back on a sound economic footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economist Mark Zandi, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain, is due to deliver a presentation on the state of the government's finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summit participants will work in small discussion groups to tackle specific issues such as tax and revenue, healthcare, Social Security, government contracting and the budget process, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TUESDAY: SPEECH TO CONGRESS, JAPANESE PM VISITS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese Prime Minister Aso makes the first visit to the White House by a foreign leader since Obama was sworn in last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During their talks from 10.30 a.m to 11.30 a.m. (1530 GMT-1630 GMT), they are expected to discuss coordinating action on reviving the global economy. Japan has been hit particularly hard by the worldwide economic slump, triggered by the U.S. housing market meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 9 p.m. (0200 GMT Wednesday), Obama heads to Capitol Hill to deliver a major speech to a joint session of Congress in which he will outline his domestic and foreign policy agenda. He is again expected to talk about the need for personal sacrifice, a theme from his inaugural address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time Obama visited Capitol Hill was shortly after his inauguration, when he sought to get opposition Republicans to support his stimulus package. Despite his bipartisan push, just three Republicans supported the recovery plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THURSDAY: BUDGET&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama will release his first budget proposal on Thursday morning, an outline of the budget for the 2010 fiscal year. A more detailed version will be released several weeks later. It is expected to put a spotlight on the deficit, which private economists expect to reach $1.5 trillion or more this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budget will reflect big increases in spending on public works that were part of the $787 billion economic recovery plan that Obama signed this week.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jim Wolf and Jason Szep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FREDERICKSBURG, Virginia/ST.JOHN'S, Antigua, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Regulators seized Texas billionaire Allen Stanford's banks and companies in Antigua and Barbuda, the Caribbean state at the center of fraud charges against him, as the financier surrendered his passport to U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antigua's government, which in 2006 gave Stanford a knighthood, and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank announced the takeovers on Friday, after a rush by depositors this week to withdraw their funds from Stanford banking affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 58, was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday with fraudulently selling $8 billion in certificates of deposit with improbably high interest rates from his Stanford International Bank Ltd (SIB), headquartered in Antigua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman Kevin Callahan said that Stanford and his two co-defendants, James Davis, SIB's chief financial officer, and Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer of a Stanford affiliate, had surrendered their passports in keeping with a judge's order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the FBI tracked Stanford down in Fredericksburg, about 50 miles south of Washington, to serve him with court papers, but a day later Stanford was nowhere to be seen in the historic Virginia town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI, Internal Revenue Service, SEC and banking regulators have been investigating allegations of fraud and other possible illegal activity by Stanford's companies for at least two years, the Washington Post reported in Saturday editions, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI was exploring bringing other charges against him, and the SEC was continuing its investigation, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the court-appointed receiver overseeing the assets of Stanford's customers -- Dallas lawyer Ralph Janvey -- said in a statement the customer accounts were frozen until legal claims could be sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a federal judge presiding over the Stanford case, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, was recused because a relative has &quot;substantial&quot; Stanford holdings, according to a court filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stanford scandal, hard on the heels of allegations that Wall Street veteran Bernard Madoff carried out a $50 billion fraud, has spooked international investors and triggered investigations in Latin America, Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru said on Friday that it had started an investigation to see if the local unit of Stanford Group had engaged in money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting at the SEC's request, FBI agents served Stanford court orders and other documents on Thursday in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Stanford is not under arrest and his precise whereabouts remained unclear on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Washington, Congressman Dennis Kucinich asked SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro to say by March 9 whether the agency suspended a 2006 investigation of Stanford. He also wants to know if it did so at the behest of another federal agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIQUIDITY WORRIES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank announced the takeover of Stanford-controlled Bank of Antigua after what it called &quot;an unusual and substantial withdrawal of funds ... which has the potential to create severe liquidity problems for the Bank.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central bank said publicity surrounding the Stanford case was threatening the interests of depositors and creditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Friday, Antigua and Barbuda's bank regulator appointed a receiver to take control of Stanford International Bank (SIB) and Stanford Trust Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford was the biggest private investor and employer in the tiny Caribbean state, for him just a part of a business empire that stretched from the United States to Latin America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fredericksburg, news crews maintained a vigil outside the family home of a woman, Andrea Stoelker, a former town resident identified by British news reports as Stanford's girlfriend and president of the board of director of a cricket tournament that Stanford sponsored in Antigua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Stanford had plans to build a global management complex, authorities suspended his company from a tax-incentive program, a senior government official said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are cooperating with the SEC,&quot; Percival Clouden, executive director of the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority, told Reuters by telephone from St. Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMPACT ON SPORTS WORLD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scandal has hit the world of international sport, where &quot;Sir Allen&quot; was a generous patron. Stanford once flew by helicopter to Britain's Lord's cricket ground with $20 million cash in sponsorship money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Friday it had terminated its contracts with Stanford's organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;ECB was shocked by the charges filed against the Stanford organization and personnel earlier this week,&quot; ECB chief executive David Collier said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scandal was expected to hit his support of other sports like polo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that U.S. federal prosecutors were investigating whether Stanford was operating a Ponzi scheme. In such a scheme, money from new investors is used to pay earlier investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Venezuela, where banking regulators estimate citizens may have had more than $2 billion invested in Stanford offshore companies, investors were counting the cost of the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle-class and well-heeled Venezuelans said they invested with Stanford because they feared their money was not safe at home under socialist President Hugo Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We love that Stanford man like we love Chavez,&quot; one well-dressed young investor said bitterly, smoking at a Stanford office, where hundreds have lined up in recent days trying to get their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's government seized Stanford's local commercial bank, a small operation holding local currency accounts, on Thursday after a run by customers using Internet facilities. The government promised to auction off the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PREVIOUS DRUGS MONEY PROBE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed charges in Dallas, Texas, on Tuesday against Stanford, two colleagues and Stanford International Bank Ltd, Stanford Group Co and Stanford Capital Management LLC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court-appointed receiver has moved to add Stanford Financial Group and Stanford Financial Group Bldg Inc to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Andean region and in Mexico and Panama, regulators have launched investigations into local Stanford affiliates, in some cases suspending their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal agents raided Stanford Group Co offices in Miami, Houston and other U.S. cities earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain's Serious Fraud Office is monitoring a possible U.K. link after media reports that Stanford's books were audited in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview on Thursday, Stanford's father, James, told Reuters that in the late 1990s, a Mexican customer of Stanford put $3 million into a Stanford bank for investment purposes. He said federal agents then approached Allen Stanford and said the money was from a Mexican drug cartel and had been laundered several times. James Stanford said his son had cooperated with the federal probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antigua has faced U.S. scrutiny in the past for alleged money laundering activities and operations by suspected Russian &quot;shell&quot; banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford's personal fortune was estimated at $2.2 billion last year by Forbes Magazine. He has donated millions of dollars to U.S. politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

<description><![CDATA[QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadorean police raided a unit of Stanford Financial Group in Quito late on Friday as part of an investigation into the local operations of the firm, charged with fraud in the United States.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51K0GO20090221</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Alonso Soto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadorean police raided a unit of Stanford Financial Group in Quito late on Friday as part of an investigation into the local operations of the firm, charged with fraud in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police wearing plastic gloves and carrying empty boxes entered the towering glass building that holds the posh offices of Stanford's brokerage firm in the capital of the Andean nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This was a raid as we are carrying out an investigation,&quot; state money laundry prosecutor Mauricio Garrido told Reuters on the phone from inside the Stanford offices. Garrido declined to give more details about the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason was not yet clear for the raid only a day after Ecuadorean regulators seized control of two local Stanford units following U.S. authorities' move to freeze the assets of Texas billionaire Allen Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities accused Stanford of fraudulently selling $8 billion in certificates of deposits with improbably high interest rates in a scheme that stretched around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru, a top cocaine producer, is investigating possible Stanford links to drug trafficking, a Peruvian regulator said. Neighboring Ecuador, a cocaine-smuggling corridor, has not mentioned any such probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuador is investigating if Stanford's local units illegally sold financial instruments linked to a bank in Antigua owned by Stanford. The total exposure of Ecuadorean investors was not yet clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government official close to the situation said police were likely searching for the identities of Stanford investors who illegally held their funds overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scandal engulfing Stanford and his financial empire rippled through Latin America, where well-off investors placed their money overseas because of fears of political and economic instability in their home countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford units in Antigua and Venezuela were seized by local authorities to calm worried investors who were desperately trying to withdraw their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECUADOR GETS TOUGHER ON FRAUD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banking regulator's office said earlier on Friday it was proposing tougher penalties on people who trick investors in financial schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed bill aims to penalize as money laundering the transfer of funds abroad by people and firms not allowed to do so by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This way authorities can sanction the ones behind pyramid schemes that have resulted in millions of dollars worth of losses for the public,&quot; the regulator said in a statement, adding that the penalties include higher fines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa, a U.S.-educated economist, often lambastes Wall Street bankers as &quot;greedy vultures&quot; and blames them for a global financial crisis that is hurting his OPEC nation's economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuadoreans are not new to swindles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An angry mob dug up the body of man accused of a pyramid scheme in 2005 that left thousands of mostly poor Ecuadoreans without their savings. They exhumed his body to make sure he was dead and had not fled the country with their money.&lt;/p&gt;

<description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will continue to press for a two-state solution in Israel's conflict with Palestinians, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said on Friday, after right-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu was asked to form Israel's next government.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51K0ER20090221</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will continue to press for a two-state solution in Israel's conflict with Palestinians, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said on Friday, after right-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu was asked to form Israel's next government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We'll have to see how events unfold in Israel, should Mr. Netanyahu become prime minister, and it will be our point of view that this remains a very important element of our approach and our policy,&quot; Rice told National Public Radio's &quot;All Things Considered&quot; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she added, &quot;Both parties have to want to work in that direction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu, 59, leads the hawkish Likud party, which backs a two-state solution, but says any future Palestinian state must be demilitarized and have limited power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Netanyahu accepted a mandate to form Israel's next government and immediately called for a broad, national unity coalition with centrist and left-wing partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a coalition might create a middle-of-the-road government immune from pressures from fringe parties that have hamstrung previous Israeli administrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was no sign that his rivals would accept, and Netanyahu may forge an alliance with far-right and ultra-religious parties, which could limit peace-making efforts with the Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu, who served as Israel's prime minister in the late 1990s, now has six weeks to put together a coalition for a second turn at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Anna Driver and Robert MacMillan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Allen Stanford, the billionaire Texan at the center of a fraud investigation that spans three continents, charmed women as well as investors and has left an angry trail of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 58, was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday with fraudulently selling $8 billion in certificates of deposit with impossibly high interest rates from his Stanford International Bank LTD (SIB), headquartered in Antigua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case has left investors in the United States and Latin America reeling as they rushed to try to recover money they invested in Stanford's organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a divorce filing in Texas and a paternity lawsuit in Florida open a window into Stanford's luxurious lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court papers show his possessions included private planes and helicopters, yachts, sailboats, expensive cars, estates in Coral Gables, Florida, St. Croix in the Virgin Islands and Antigua in the West Indies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation served Stanford with court papers on Thursday in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where the family of a woman said in media reports to be his girlfriend has a home. He has not been arrested and has not been charged with any crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His whereabouts had been the subject of intense speculation since Tuesday after he failed to respond to an SEC subpoena&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC said on Friday that Stanford and his two co-defendants, James Davis, SIB's chief financial officer, and Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer of a Stanford affiliate, had surrendered their passports in keeping with a judge's order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNHAPPY TRAILS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan Stanford is suing for divorce in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louise Sage, who bore Stanford two children, though they never married, filed a paternity lawsuit in Florida. Sage and Stanford later settled the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sage filed her lawsuit as &quot;Louise Sage Stanford,&quot; though her lawyer in the case, Maurice Jay Kutner, said that she and Allen Stanford were never married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;His morality with the females was not necessarily reflective of his business skills,&quot; said Richard Goswick, son of O.Y. Goswick, a Stanford board member who had a stroke several years ago and can no longer communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Goswick knows Stanford because both families are from Mexia, a small town in east central Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Stanford, Stanford's 81-year-old father, told Reuters that his son has six children from several women. At least two are from a woman he did not marry, the elder Stanford said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen Stanford lives in the United States and the Caribbean, primarily St. Croix and Antigua. He and his company have lavished money on international sports including cricket, sailing, tennis and golf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan Stanford married him in 1975, seven years after he graduated from high school in Forth Worth, Texas. The couple has long been separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She filed for divorce in November 2007, and the case is still pending. Her lawyers have asked Allen Stanford to pay $225,000 in attorney's fees to one of Susan Stanford's lawyers, plus smaller amounts to other lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In state court filings in Texas, she has asked the court to award her &quot;exclusive use and control&quot; of two Mercedes, a Porsche Boxster, a home in Houston's upscale Tanglewood neighborhood and a condominium in a Houston building called the Huntingdon, where the widow of former Enron chairman Ken Lay lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan Stanford has also asked the court to grant her access to community assets including the estates in Antigua and St. Croix, all jets, yachts and access to VIP suites for events including Houston Rockets professional basketball games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford, who was knighted in Antigua and is known as &quot;Sir Allen,&quot; in the past has ruffled the well-mannered world of international cricket by partying with the players' girlfriends. He was once photographed with the wife of a member of the English national cricket team sitting on his knee.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - The federal judge presiding over the U.S. government's civil fraud case against Texas billionaire Allen Stanford has been recused because a relative has &quot;substantial holdings&quot; managed by the Stanford Group Co, according to a court filing on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case, which had been overseen by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, will be reassigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;As litigation progresses, the relative's conduct and holdings are likely to be affected by and subject to further orders of the court,&quot; putting the judge's impartiality in question, said an order signed by U.S. District Judge Sam Lindsay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford, some of his companies and two top executives were charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday with falsely marketing $8 billion in high-yield certificates of deposit as safe, all the while secretly placing client funds in illiquid private equity and real estate holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stanford remains a free man despite fraud charges</title>

<description><![CDATA[NEW YORK (Reuters) - For all the accusations of wrongdoing swirling around globe-trotting financier Allen Stanford, he faces no criminal charges and remains a free man.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J6IK20090220</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Martha Graybow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - For all the accusations of wrongdoing swirling around globe-trotting financier Allen Stanford, he faces no criminal charges and remains a free man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas billionaire and well-known sports patron has been charged with defrauding investors around the world in a civil lawsuit by U.S. financial regulators, who have no powers to seek a prison term when they bring a case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But legal experts say that, based on the alleged wrongdoing portrayed in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint, they think criminal charges carrying possible stiff prison terms would almost surely follow in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given these types of allegations, it would be surprising if the Department of Justice was not actively investigating with the view toward seeking an indictment,&quot; said Robert McGahan, a partner at law firm Goodwin Procter LLP in Los Angeles and a former federal prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McGahan, who is not involved in the Stanford case, said the size of the alleged fraud and the allegations of direct misrepresentations to investors laid out by the SEC were likely attracting attention from prosecutors if they had not already been investigating the matter on their own previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford, some of his companies, and two top executives were charged by the SEC this week with falsely marketing $8 billon in high-yield CDs as safe investments, all the while secretly placing client funds in illiquid private equity and real estate holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas federal court complaint says Stanford's firm reported &quot;improbable results&quot; for its investment portfolio and that the defendants engaged in &quot;unscrupulous and illegal activity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers across the Americas and the Caribbean have been frantically trying to get their money back from Stanford's far-flung financial empire, which includes the Stanford International Bank Ltd in the small Caribbean country of Antigua and Barbuda and his Houston-based U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department has not commented on the matter. FBI agents served Stanford with a formal copy of the SEC fraud complaint after tracking him down in Virginia on Thursday, but they did not arrest him or charge him with any crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two federal law enforcement officials, who declined to be identified because the investigation is ongoing, told Reuters criminal charges against Stanford are not imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One official said such investigations tend to be complex and can take time, involving complicated financial transactions and interviews with numerous people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;They do not happen overnight,&quot; this person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC has a court order to freeze Stanford's assets and confiscate his passport, and the agency plans to seek civil penalties. The SEC said on Friday that Stanford had surrendered his passport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lower burden of proof for the government in civil cases, which requires proof of the charges based on a &quot;preponderance&quot; of evidence. In a criminal case, the standard is higher, with proof required beyond reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal experts said it is unusual, although not unheard of, for securities regulators to bring charges in a case before prosecutors decide whether to bring parallel criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they said the SEC may decide to move first when it sees a risk that client funds could disappear. By stepping in, the regulators can try to freeze assets and stop the defendant from doing business. The SEC has said Stanford and his lieutenants were engaged in a &quot;massive, ongoing fraud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The fastest way to get a legal action is to use the civil system,&quot; said Linnea McCord, a professor of business law at Pepperdine University in California. &quot;Then at a later date, when they are able to get further information, it is entirely possible for them (the government) to file a criminal action if warranted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jim Wolf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FREDERICKSBURG, Virginia (Reuters) - Texas billionaire Allen Stanford was nowhere to be seen on Friday in this historic Virginia town, site of a fierce battle in the American Civil War and reputed through local lore to be haunted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The home of relatives of a woman said to be a girlfriend of Stanford became a magnet for reporters and photographers, but there were no signs that anyone was inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intense speculation had surrounded Stanford's whereabouts since Tuesday, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against him, two of his colleagues and three of his companies, accusing them of an $8 billion fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford, who failed to respond to a subpoena earlier this week, surfaced here on Thursday and was served with court papers related to the SEC charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An American flag fluttered in the cold breeze above the doorway of this modest, three-story brick house that belongs to relatives of Andrea Stoelker, according to a cross-referencing data bank and the Free Lance-Star, a Fredericksburg newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stoelker is a former local resident identified in published reports as president of the board of directors of a cricket tournament that Stanford sponsored in Antigua, headquarters of his Stanford International Bank (SIB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI said its agents were acting at the request of the SEC when they served Stanford with papers in Fredericksburg, about 50 miles south of Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were helping out there to locate and serve papers,&quot; said Bill Carter, an FBI spokesman in Washington. Stanford, 58, was not taken into custody, Carter said. He declined to discuss how Stanford had been located. Other officials said he was not a fugitive and had not been hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one at the Stoelkers' house returned a message left on an answering machine that greeted callers: &quot;You've reached the Stoelkers. We're not available to take your call right now. Please leave a message, and we'll call you back as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman Kevin Callahan said that Stanford and his two co-defendants had surrendered their passports in keeping with a judge's order. The co-defendants are James Davis, SIB's chief financial officer, and Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer of a Stanford affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callahan declined to comment on when and where the passports had been given up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also uncertain was an ABC News report that Stanford had retained attorney Brendan Sullivan of Williams &amp;amp; Connolly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about the ABC report, one of Sullivan's assistants, Rhonda Meadows, told Reuters early Friday: &quot;Mr. Sullivan has not been retained.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Free Lance-Star reader e-mailed the paper Thursday night, saying Stanford had picked up a tab for the reader's family dinner at a local restaurant, Claiborne's, on November 7 after the family agreed to give up its earlier reservation time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reader wrote that he had introduced himself as Allen Stanford, said he lived in the Virgin Islands and that his girlfriend's parents lived in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a local tour operator, Fredericksburg has a reputation as &quot;one of the most haunted locales in the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;With a long history dating back to preColonial times, and a legacy of slavery and war, it is no wonder that so many unhappy phantoms wander the streets,&quot; the tour operator says in promotional material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Fredericksburg was fought in the area in December 1862.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J6CY20090220</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Svea Herbst-Bayliss&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - As financial markets stumbled this week, Trent Rosenthal wanted to trade in stocks. But he made a horrific discovery -- thousands of dollars in his brokerage account were frozen thanks to Stanford Group Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Rosenthal became the first person to file a lawsuit asking a federal judge to dissolve an order freezing assets that put him and thousands of others into financial limbo this week, court documents show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal, a Houston-based lawyer, is representing himself in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed in the Northern District of Texas Forth Worth Division four days after U.S. officials charged Stanford with having run a &quot;massive, ongoing fraud&quot; and a federal judge in Texas froze the company's assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The market is fluctuating and I would like to be able to be in control of my financial destiny,&quot; Rosenthal said in an interview, adding &quot;This is customer property not Stanford Group Company property.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal's suit illustrates the wide reach Stanford's purported fraud is having and how it is affecting even investors who never relied on the Texas-company's investment advisers for advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal said his frozen brokerage account is valued between $50,000 and $100,000 and said it holds two securities that are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. He was exasperated that Sir Allen Stanford, the company's head, is free to move around after having been charged with fraud while his own money is locked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm upset because I'm entangled in a fraud even though I had not bought any CDs issued by Stanford or other securities that the Securities and Exchange Commission are probing now,&quot; Rosenthal said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he is not alone. A sense of urgency is spreading among other clients whose brokerage accounts are also frozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One retiree, who asked not to be identified, said he needs the money that is currently frozen to pay for rent and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The next big issue will be getting the non-CD, legitimate securities released and we are very nervous about that,&quot; said Randy Pulman, a partner at law firm Pulman, Cappuccio and Pullen, who also has clients whose brokerages are frozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securities and cash owned by Rosenthal and other Stanford brokerage customers are held in custody at Pershing LLC, a unit of the Bank of New York Mellon Corp which is one of the world's biggest custodial banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until further notice Stanford's clients' brokerage accounts held at Pershing have been frozen on request of the receiver and no funds or securities may leave the brokerage accounts without the receiver's approval,&quot; Pershing spokesman Michael Geller said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some Stanford brokerage account holders, who have called Pershing's New Jersey offices for assistance, say they are frustrated that they were told to contact the receiver where they say no one was available to speak to them in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The receiver in the Stanford case told investors on Friday they could contact their brokers to sell stock in their account, but they could not transfer assets to another firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cash and securities in customer accounts with third party, independent clearing brokers remain frozen for the foreseeable future, the receiver said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;All of us have been unfairly singled out in this mess,&quot; said Rosenthal, who moved his brokerage account to Stanford several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I came over when my broker moved from Wachovia to Stanford and they really courted me,&quot; Rosenthal said, remembering &quot;They supported a lot of charities and that was certainly important to me.&quot; Stanford has donated money to a cancer hospital, art museum as well as libraries and schools, according to their corporate reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Rosenthal hopes a judge will act quickly on his motion. &quot;The order freezing assets has far reaching consequences and I hope to get an answer soon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank seized control on Friday of the Bank of Antigua, a commercial bank controlled by Texas billionaire Allen Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central bank took over the bank in the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda after &quot;an unusual and substantial withdrawal of funds,&quot; the bank said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford, who was knighted by Antigua in 2006 and holds citizenship there, was accused this week by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of carrying out a massive fraud through Antigua-based Stanford International Bank (SIB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC said in a complaint filed on Tuesday in Dallas, Texas, that SIB sold $8 billion in certificates of deposit promising impossibly high return rates. SIB, Stanford Group Co, and Stanford Capital Management LLC were named in the complaint along with Allen Stanford, his aide James Davis, and O.Y. Goswick, a Stanford board member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central bank said publicity surrounding the case had created a situation where the interests of depositors and creditors were threatened and the bank &quot;is likely to become unable to meet its obligations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Friday, Antigua and Barbuda's bank regulator appointed a receiver to take control of SIB and Stanford Trust Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - The rarefied, glamorous world of polo, the so-called sport of kings, is at risk of losing one of its major U.S. benefactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas billionaire Allen Stanford, whose financial group sponsors numerous polo clubs and events, has been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with an $8 billion securities fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jet-setting 58-year-old tycoon, who has denied any wrongdoing, was served civil papers in Virginia on Thursday by FBI agents. The flamboyant financier's fortune was estimated at $2.2 billion last year by Forbes magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has donated millions of dollars to U.S. politicians, and has secured endorsements from such sports stars as golfer Vijay Singh and soccer player Michael Owen. His sports endorsement deals also likely total in the millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Stanford Financial Group backs many sports, including cricket, golf and tennis, polo is unique because it is so niche and beyond the understanding of most Americans. Stanford is also involved with a series of polo teams and venues in the United States, and one major event in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the company's website, the sport is described glowingly as combining &quot;the techniques of 'riding like a Comanche, thinking like a chess player and hitting like a golf pro while four players try to break your kneecaps.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polo was first played in the United States in 1876, coming over from England. Many early polo matches attracted as many as 20,000 spectators, and coverage in the sports pages equal to other major sports. Major events still draw as many as 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each polo match consists of six chukkers, or periods, lasting 7-1/2 minutes, during which two teams of four ride horses that can be worth up to $200,000. Teams try to score by driving a small white ball into the opponent's goal using a long-handled mallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some people compare it to field hockey on horseback, or soccer,&quot; said John Wash, president of operations for the International Polo Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Stanford serves as title sponsor for one of the club's nine fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway through a match, fans come out on the field for the ceremonial stomping of the divots, where they replace mounds of earth torn up by the horses while also socializing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Polo is not only a fascinating sport, it is a fascinating society, and for many, the parties and people-watching are as much fun as the game,&quot; the Houston Polo Club website said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sport is expensive, however, as a team owner, or patron, can spend up to $2 million a year, Wash said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies spend up to $1 million or more on sponsorships, although most winning teams walk away with nothing more than a trophy or plaque at what are mostly charity events, industry executives said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, polo officials said no single sponsor is so large that his absence would severely hurt the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The sport's been played for thousands of years. It's one of the oldest sports in the world,&quot; Wash said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have different sponsors that approach us in different categories like any other professional sport,&quot; he added. &quot;As we watch this thing play out, it may open the doors for somebody else.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, Stanford Financial Group has already paid &quot;a couple hundred thousand dollars&quot; to remain a sponsor this year at the Palm Beach club, whose season runs through April 26 when it hosts the U.S. Open polo championship, Wash said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford Financial has long looked at sports marketing as critical to its growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We look to partner with national and international sports organizations that offer a consistently high-quality event experience and premium branding opportunities,&quot; Stanford Financial Executive Director Jay Comeaux said in a statement in 2006 announcing a sponsorship deal with a basketball team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also has a venue deal with the Houston Polo Club, and sponsors the U.S. Polo Association's U.S. Open and Governor's Cup events, as well as various local and regional U.S. polo matches, according to the company website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has been the title sponsor the last four years of the Stanford Charity Polo Day, which is hosted by Prince Charles in aid of the British Forces Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polo, with 4,000 registered players and almost 300 U.S. clubs, will not fade simply because of the possible loss of one sponsor, said Peter Rizzo, executive director of the U.S. Polo Association. The recession worries him more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;With or without Stanford's sponsorship, the U.S. Open will be played,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously, anything like this (recession) affects our country and the financial well-being of this country is going to affect sports.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Iran understates uranium stocks to IAEA: diplomats</title>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Mark Heinrich&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran recently understated by a third how much uranium it had enriched and U.N. nuclear inspectors are working with Tehran to ensure such a significant gap does not recur, diplomats said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency believes the discrepancy was a technical mistake rather than subterfuge, but the matter is important given concerns, denied by Tehran, that it is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An IAEA report Thursday showed a significant increase in Iran's reported stockpile of low-enriched uranium (LEU) since November to 1,010 kg, which U.S. analysts said could be converted into enough high-enriched uranium for one bomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even then, the technical steps needed to &quot;weaponize&quot; enrichment would probably take two to five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New figures in the report revealed that Iran had under-reported how much LEU it had amassed, raising new questions about the ability of the restricted inspectors' mission in Iran to keep track of Iranian nuclear advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report said the 1,010 kg was based on an additional 171 kg from new production on top of 839 kg of previous output which inspectors had verified in November. But the last IAEA report at that time put the amount at 630 kg, based on Iran's estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomats familiar with the matter said the IAEA had concluded the discrepancy was due to faulty estimates that can arise from complexities in the phased enrichment process, not to any maneuver to divert LEU out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report stressed that all nuclear material at Iran's underground Natanz enrichment plant, except for some waste and samples, was under regular IAEA containment and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONE INVENTORY A YEAR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the diplomats said the verified LEU figure was based on an inventory check that inspectors perform only once a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, this means there is a risk that any smuggling of enriched uranium out of Natanz for use at a secret site might not be noticed for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.N. inspectors are discussing with Iran how to improve its operating records to prevent any repeat of such large differences in accounting in future, the diplomats said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This doesn't mean nuclear safeguards aren't working. But the IAEA will have to do the inventories more often as the amounts increase,&quot; said David Albright, a senior non-proliferation analyst in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;All this reinforces the point that if Iran does divert material, it doesn't mean the IAEA knows right away. This could be delayed a number of weeks, particularly if Iran stalls on allowing them into the plant,&quot; he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The (broader issue) is that Iran has crippled the IAEA's ability to detect undeclared activities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran says it wants a nuclear fuel industry solely to meet growing electricity demand and has promised to preserve IAEA monitoring of its two declared uranium production centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it has severely curbed IAEA movements since being hit with U.N. sanctions -- which it calls illegal -- for refusing to suspend enrichment and failing to open up to an IAEA inquiry into allegations of past atom bomb research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It now bars IAEA access to plants developing new centrifuges and other enrichment machinery, and to a heavy-water reactor under construction. This means inspectors cannot verify that no parallel, military-oriented work is under way in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. says alarmed by latest IAEA report on Iran</title>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington expressed alarm on Friday over new evidence that Iran understated how much uranium it enriched, calling Tehran's nuclear program an &quot;urgent problem&quot; the international community must address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new report by the International Atomic Energy Agency this week said Iran had built up a stockpile of nuclear fuel. Diplomats said Iran had underreported by a third how much uranium it had enriched but that the IAEA believed the discrepancy was a technical mistake rather than subterfuge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The report represents another lost opportunity for Iran as it continues to renege on its international obligations,&quot; said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, echoing earlier comments by the U.S. State Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It does underscore the urgency which the international community must work together to address these enrichment activities. This is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed and we cannot delay addressing,&quot; Gibbs said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States suspects Iran of trying to use its nuclear program to build an atomic bomb, but Tehran insists that is purely for the peaceful generation of electricity. Enriched uranium can be used to make nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>GM's Europe brands survival dependent on state aid</title>

<description><![CDATA[FRANKFURT/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's European brands are near collapse, with Germany's Opel in need of more state funding and the Swedish government rejecting Saab's plea for state aid until its business plan was sound.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J5N520090220</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Christiaan Hetzner and Victoria Klesty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's European brands are near collapse, with Germany's Opel in need of more state funding and the Swedish government rejecting Saab's plea for state aid until its business plan was sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filing for protection from creditors on Friday, Saab said it would present a reorganization proposal within three weeks while court filings revealed it estimates its losses in 2008 and 2009 at around 3 billion Swedish crowns ($340.1 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockholm's Industry Minister said the information received about Saab's situation on Friday was not enough for the Swedish government to provide the carmaker with loan guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have told GM we have doubts about this business plan,&quot; Maud Olofsson told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, the White House and U.S. Treasury Department on Friday convened the first meeting of a task force set to determine by March 31 whether GM and Chrysler LLC, can be competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Fiat agreed with lenders on a new line of credit, Moody's said weak cash flow and lower contributions from Volvo and Nissan and led it to downgrade Renault's debt two notches to Ba1, the highest rated junk category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opel became the first European carmaker to seek a government bailout since the crisis began. It requires a total of 3.3 billion euros ($4.15 billion) in liquidity to keep it afloat through the end of 2011 when it launches four new models including the Chevy Volt-sister Ampera, a company source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opel will ask for total state guarantees for loans that would amount to around 2.6 billion euros, with contributions in labor cost cuts from its workforce to provide the remaining 700 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from a continued plunge in European car markets and a painful weakening in key currencies, the presentation of GM's comprehensive viability plan introduced a totally new and unpredictable variable into Opel's financing equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the new Insignia manufactured in Russelsheim with right-hand drive and a Vauxhall badge is priced for the UK market according to a stronger sterling-euro exchange course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We end up losing a couple of thousand euros per car,&quot; the source said. &quot;And we also have a huge problem with the rubel. You cannot increase prices (on Opels exported to Russia from western Europe) as fast as the currency depreciates.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent to Reuters, Opel finance chief Marco Mollinari confirmed new developments mean it now requires more than the initial 1.8 billion euros in guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A source at the German government said Opel had explained the situation could become dramatic by March with its cash tight and a threat looming of balance-sheet insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News of the higher funding needs could weaken political supporters who have argued in favor of extending guarantees, conjuring up images of Hypo Real Estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German covered bond specialist received more than 100 billion euros in aid after multiple funding shortfalls were discovered at its Irish state financing unit Depfa, sparking a controversial debate over its possible nationalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOSTILE TAKEOVER&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the matter said that Berlin was informed in advance of growing problems at Opel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's entirely clear that (Opel) cannot become a bottomless hole. When you talk about a plan then there must be one sum that can sustain a business model until time 'X' without any ifs ands or buts,&quot; that person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockholm's Industry Minister called GM's business plan for Saab &quot;still too optimistic&quot; and warned the parent the government would not hand out guarantees to companies not sound or solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olofsson, who has repeatedly ruled out owning carmakers, demanded that GM answer how it plans to make Saab profitable and provide the resources necessary to launch new car models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a first step of goodwill, GM's global purchasing boss Bo Andersson said the parent would establish a &quot;mechanism&quot; that ensures suppliers to Saab are paid in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposing to concentrate design, engineering and manufacturing in Sweden, Saab said Friday the court-appointed administrator's reorganization would take three months and require independent funding as it seeks a new investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even though we have not been actively searching for new partners, we have had many knocking on our door showing interest in Saab,&quot; its chief executive, Jan-Ake Jonsson, told a news conference in the carmaker's hometown of Trollhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis has come at a tough time for Saab just as it is scheduled to launch badly needed new models like the upcoming 9-5, which were set to rejuvenate its elderly product range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opel itself plans to roll out the fourth generation of its bestseller, the Astra hatchback, and all knew versions of the Meriva and Zafira minivans in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Q&amp;A: Stanford Bank fallout in Latin America</title>

<description><![CDATA[(Reuters) - Latin America has been hard hit by accusations that Texas billionaire Allen Stanford perpetrated a giant scam with some $8 billion in high-yield certificates of deposit sold by Stanford International Bank.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J5GJ20090220</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Latin America has been hard hit by accusations that Texas billionaire Allen Stanford perpetrated a giant scam with some $8 billion in high-yield certificates of deposit sold by Stanford International Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford securities issued out of the Caribbean island of Antigua were heavily marketed in countries such as Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Mexico where political and economic instability make savers unwilling to keep money at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are basic questions and answers about Stanford Bank's impact in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: How much money did Latin Americans invest in Stanford's high yield deposits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: The combined total is believed to be several billion dollars, though authorities still do not have clear figures because they did not regulate offshore securities. Venezuelans could have put $2.5 billion in the CDs, the banking regulator said, but admitted that was a loose estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: What types of people had money with Stanford?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Unlike Bernard Madoff's now-infamous pyramid scheme which targeted the uber-wealthy, Stanford sold heavily to Latin America's middle and upper-middle class savers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venezuelans wary of President Hugo Chavez's socialist crusade used Stanford to stash money offshore and escape galloping inflation and currency controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent high-profile pyramid schemes in Ecuador and Colombia, upper middle class people in both countries were lured by the promises of security and higher returns on their dollar deposits than they would get in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still not clear if household name Latin Americans also lost money in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: Why was Stanford so successful in Latin America?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: In part because the region has a history of bank failures, hyperinflation and political instability. The rise of populist governments such as Chavez and Ecuador's Rafael Correa have left wealthier residents worried the government could snatch their savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru, which has extensive illegal coca cultivation, has begun investigating possible links to narcotrafficking. The government of Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producer, has not mentioned any such investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: How can Latin Americans get their money back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Funds in Stanford accounts are currently frozen after a U.S. Federal Court in Texas put the company in the hands of a receiver. Depositors seeking their money will likely rely on legal action in the United States against Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the receiver will have to determine how much money is available to return to depositors and which depositors will receive priority. The receiver is only now starting the process of valuing Stanford's assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: Are Latin Americans panicking over the Stanford situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Though angry depositors have formed lines outside Stanford offices, the response has remained measured. Most people involved have received promises -- possibly false ones -- that their money will be returned to them. They are unlikely to speak out unless it becomes clear they have lost their investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors have also avoided publicly complaining because they do not for security reasons want to be identified as wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Roman Kozhevnikov&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUSHANBE (Reuters) - Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will allow the transit by land of non-military NATO cargo to Afghanistan, a U.S. commander said on Friday, as Washington seeks alternative supply routes for its troops there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rear Admiral Mark Harnitchek of the U.S. Transportation Command said the United States planned to send 50 to 200 containers a week to Afghanistan through the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement follows a decision by pro-Moscow Kyrgyzstan to close the only U.S. air base in Central Asia, accusing Washington of refusing to pay more rent for the base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sent a formal notice to the U.S. ambassador in the capital Bishkek on Friday, giving U.S. troops 180 days to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the eviction notice, the Pentagon said the United States still believed it could reach a deal with Kyrgyzstan to maintain the Manas base, a key hub for moving personnel and equipment into Afghanistan for U.S. and NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I continue to believe this is not a closed issue but that there remains potential to reopen this with the Kyrgyz and to reach a new agreement,&quot; U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in Krakow, Poland, where NATO defense ministers were meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyzstan's decision removes one of the U.S. military's supply routes into Afghanistan as Washington prepares to send more troops to the country to fight a Taliban insurgency that is growing in strength there and in neighboring Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies fly troops and supplies from bases in Europe and the Gulf and could increase this traffic to make up for the loss of Manas air base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW COMMITMENTS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With international forces bogged down more than seven years after overthrowing the Taliban, Washington has struggled to persuade allies to provide more soldiers to complement the 17,000 extra troops it is sending to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gates said on Friday the Obama administration expected &quot;significant new commitments&quot; from allies on troops or civilian assistance for Afghanistan before an April 3-4 summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said if countries were unable to increase military commitments, contributions to efforts to boost development and governance would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I expect there will be significant new commitments on either the civilian or the military side in connection with the NATO summit,&quot; he told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gates said in the two-day meeting in Krakow, 19-20 NATO states had announced new commitments. &quot;I consider that a good start as we begin to look toward the summit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe we are facing a very tough test in Afghanistan. I have no doubt that we will rise to the occasion,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Gates received only a limited response to a call for allies to do their fair share by sending more forces to provide security for Afghanistan's August 20 presidential poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate development, Britain said on Friday it hoped to get formal agreement on a proposal to create a small NATO rapid deployment force to defend mainland Europe and free up troops for Afghan duty at the NATO summit in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Defense Secretary John Hutton presented the proposal at the NATO meeting in Krakow, saying it was aimed at reassuring NATO's East European members and encouraging NATO states to commit more forces to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sen. Burris should resign, Illinois governor says</title>

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J52120090220</guid>
<media:content url="http://www.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20090220&amp;t=2&amp;i=8347118&amp;w="  type="image/jpeg"  expression="full"  medium="image" ></media:content>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Pat Quinn called on Friday for Roland Burris to resign the U.S. Senate seat formerly occupied by President Barack Obama because of the cloud of controversy hanging over his appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burris also came under pressure from the White House, with Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs saying, &quot;I think it might be important for Senator Burris to take some time this weekend to either correct what has been said and certainly think of what lays in his future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Burris resigns, Quinn said he would make a temporary appointment until a special election could be held to fill the seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an election would require a new state law -- and it would give Republicans a shot at picking up a seat in the Senate where Democrats now control 58 of the 100 seats, with one seat vacant due to a contested election in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quinn's predecessor, Rod Blagojevich, was impeached and ousted by the state's legislature in part because of charges he tried to sell the seat Obama once occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a gigantic mistake for him (Burris) to take the appointment in the first place,&quot; Quinn told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Burris' chief of staff, Darrel Thompson, who previously worked in Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office, resigned to rejoin the Nevada Democrat's staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quinn, Blagojevich and Burris are all Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Blagojevich defied members of his own party to appoint Burris on December 30, inconsistencies have emerged in Burris' testimony, affidavits and public comments about his contacts with the then-governor's staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local prosecutor is exploring perjury charges and the Senate's ethics committee has begun an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick Durbin, the senior senator from Illinois, told the Chicago Sun-Times he had grown weary of the controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durbin and other Democratic Senate leaders initially refused to seat Burris, saying his appointment was tainted, but bowed to pressure from black colleagues in the House of Representatives and to Obama's urging that they end the stand-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm tired of this Blagojevich burlesque that's been going on for so long. The people of our state should be spared this,&quot; Durbin told the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>British resident to be freed from Guantanamo Bay</title>

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J41H20090220</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Luke Baker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The United States has agreed to release Binyam Mohamed, a British resident held at the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay for the past five years without charge, Britain's Foreign Office said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision follows a formal request by Britain to the United States in August 2007 asking for the remaining five British residents held at the camp on Cuba to be released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three have already been freed, and since President Barack Obama came to office, extra efforts have been made to secure the release of Mohamed, an Ethiopian citizen. A fifth detainee, Shaker Aamer, is considered a threat and will remain in custody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The UK and U.S. governments have reached agreement on the transfer of Mr Binyam Mohamed from Guantanamo Bay to the UK,&quot; the Foreign Office said in a statement. &quot;He will be returned as soon as the practical arrangements can be made.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mohamed might be transferred as soon as Monday. It would be the first transfer of a Guantanamo prisoner since Obama, who has pledged to close the camp, took office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohamed, 30, was arrested in Pakistan in April 2002. He says he was tortured and abused by foreign agents while in custody there, and later flown to Morocco on a CIA plane, where he was again tortured, before being transferred to Guantanamo in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has denied he was subjected to &quot;extraordinary rendition,&quot; and Morocco has denied ever holding him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has been accused of training at al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and plotting to set off a radioactive bomb in the United States, but no charges have been brought against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohamed's case has received widespread coverage in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Britain's High Court reluctantly ruled evidence of the torture he was subjected to should remain classified after the United States said releasing it could threaten intelligence cooperation between Washington and London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMMIGRATION STATUS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohamed's lawyers were pleased by news he is to be freed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Right now we're just happy, I'm just thrilled that he is coming back to the UK,&quot; said Yvonne Bradley, an American military officer who has acted as his lawyer at Guantanamo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;His desire is to stay in the UK ... He is not the first resident to be returned home and I hope he gets treated in the same way,&quot; she told Sky News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British officials have said that Mohamed will be a free man when he returns to Britain, but have also said that his immigration status will be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr Mohamed's return does not constitute a commitment by the home secretary (interior minister) that he may remain permanently in the UK,&quot; the Foreign Office said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The same security considerations will apply to him as would apply to any other foreign national in this country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British diplomats and a doctor traveled to Guantanamo Bay last week to assess Mohamed's medical condition. He had been on a hunger strike for more than a month and his lawyers were concerned that he could die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohamed was persuaded to end his hunger strike and assessed to be healthy enough to be flown back to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday promised careful oversight of a $787 billion stimulus package he signed into law this week and said he would call to task any instances of government waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with an economy mired in a deep recession, Obama made the package of public works spending projects, social-service spending and tax cuts the centerpiece of his agenda for jumpstarting growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republicans, most of whom refused to support the stimulus measure, criticized the bill as laden with wasteful spending that they said would do little to revive the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Obama and the Democratic-led Congress have rejected that characterization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an event at the White House attended by many of the nation's mayors, Obama said the stimulus plan would create jobs and promote long-term growth through spending to repair crumbling roads, build high-speed rail projects and expand broadband infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He emphasized the plan would be implemented &quot;without waste, inefficiency, or fraud&quot; and promised to appoint a team of managers to oversee the spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;If a federal agency proposes a project that will waste that money, I will not hesitate to call them out on it, and put a stop to it,&quot; Obama said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want everyone here to be on notice that if a local government does the same -- I will call them out on it as well, and use the full power of my office and our administration to stop it,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jim Wolf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FREDERICKSBURG, Virginia (Reuters) - The whereabouts of embattled Texas financier Allen Stanford were a mystery again Friday after the FBI served him a formal complaint in this historic hub noted for ghost stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Television crews maintained a vigil outside the family home of a woman reputed to be a girlfriend of Stanford, but there were no signs that he was at the house overnight. Lights were out from early evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modest, three-story, brick-faced townhome belongs to relatives of Andrea Stoelker, according to a cross-referencing data bank and the Free Lance-Star, a Fredericksburg newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Stanford of defrauding 50,000 customers around the world in a multibillion-dollar investment scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting at the request of the SEC, FBI agents caught up with Stanford on Thursday in Fredericksburg, which lies halfway between Washington and the old Confederate capital in Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were helping out there to locate and serve papers,&quot; said Bill Carter, an FBI spokesman in Washington. Stanford, 58, was not taken into custody or arrested, he said. Carter declined to say how Stanford had been located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one at the Stoelkers' house returned a message left on an answering machine that greeted callers with: &quot;You've reached the Stoelkers. We're not available to take your call right now. Please leave a message and we'll call you back as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were conflicting reports about whether Stanford had surrendered his passport yet. One law enforcement official told Reuters on Thursday that he was making arrangements to do so. ABC News, however, said he had done so Thursday and then driven to Fredericksburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter referred questions about the passport to the SEC. Kevin Callahan, an SEC spokesman, said he could not immediately clarify the status of Stanford's passport, which a court has ordered him to turn over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also uncertain was an ABC News report that Stanford had hired Williams &amp;amp; Connolly partner Brendan Sullivan, one of Washington's best-known criminal defense lawyers, to represent him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about the ABC report, one of Sullivan's assistants, Rhonda Meadows, told Reuters: &quot;Mr. Sullivan has not been retained.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed civil charges in Dallas on Tuesday against Stanford and two colleagues, as well as Stanford International Bank Ltd, Stanford Group Co and Stanford Capital Management LLC. The agency accuses them of a &quot;massive, ongoing fraud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until regulators got help Thursday from the FBI, the SEC could not find Stanford. His whereabouts had been the subject of intense speculation since he failed to respond to an SEC subpoena to answer questions about his company's operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials did not say how the FBI learned that Stanford was in Virginia, but they said he had not been hiding and he was not a fugitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British news reports had identified Andrea Stoelker, a former local resident, as Stanford's girlfriend and president of the board of directors of a cricket tournament that he sponsors in Antigua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An encounter last November between a Free Lance-Star reader and Stanford seemed to support the idea that his girlfriend has local ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reader e-mailed the paper Thursday night, saying Stanford bought the reader's family dinner at a local restaurant, Claiborne's, on November 7 after the family agreed to give up its earlier reservation time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He introduced himself as Allen Stanford, said he lived in the Virgin Islands and that his girlfriend's parents lived in the area, the reader wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a local tour operator, Fredericksburg has a reputation as &quot;one of the most haunted locales in the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;With a long history dating back to pre-Colonial times, and a legacy of slavery and war, it is no wonder that so many unhappy phantoms wander the streets,&quot; the tour operator says in promotional material.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - General Motors' German unit Opel is seeking from its government and labor force help in financing a 3.3 billion euro ($4.15 billion) liquidity gap through the end of 2011, a source at the group said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opel is asking for total state guarantees for loans that would amount to around 2.6 billion euros, with contributions in labor cost cuts from its workforce to provide the remaining 700 million euros, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously GM Europe President Carl-Peter Forster has said the company was looking for between 1-2 billion euros in loan guarantees from the German state to fund operations during a critical 2009 and 2010 when Opel is set to launch the fourth generation of its best-seller, the Astra hatchback.&lt;/p&gt;

<description><![CDATA[NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc shares fell for a sixth straight day on Friday, hammered by growing fears that the U.S. government could nationalize the banks, wiping out shareholders.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51I4R720090220</guid>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Juan Lagorio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc shares fell for a sixth straight day on Friday, hammered by growing fears that the U.S. government could nationalize the banks, wiping out shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a roller-coaster session, investors' concerns about the health of two of the largest U.S. banks were somewhat assuaged by the end of the day after the White House said President Barack Obama favored a privately held banking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Obama were inclined to take control of troubled banks -- and the bank rescue plan recently outlined by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner leaves that question unanswered -- he would be taking a political gamble as the country is showing signs of &quot;bailout fatigue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America and Citigroup shares fell as much as 35 percent by mid-session after Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said it might be necessary for the government to take control of some banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup shares ended down 22.3 percent at $1.95 after earlier hitting $1.61, their lowest price since 1990. Bank of America shares ended down 3.6 percent at $3.79 after touching $2.53, their lowest level since 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both stocks have lost more than 90 percent of their value in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's market capitalization shrank to $10.6 billion, making it worth less than asset administrator Northern Trust Corp. Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is now worth $24.2 billion, almost what it paid for Merrill Lynch just seven weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The values of the companies seem so ridiculously depressed because no one believes in their values, and no one believes in their values because they think the government is going to take them over,&quot; said Ken Crawford, senior portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crawford said the government could be forced to nationalize Citigroup and Bank of America if their share prices keep falling and their survival is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KBW Financial index fell just 0.6 percent at 21.70 after hitting an all-time low of 19.58, with Wells Fargo Co sliding 9 percent to $10.91, and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co ending down 3.4 percent at $19.90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said in a statement, &quot;We see no reason why a company that is profitable with strong levels of capital and liquidity and that continues to lend actively should be considered for nationalization.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup spokesman Jon Diat said in an e-mailed statement that the bank's capital base is &quot;very strong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, BofA posted its first quarterly loss in 17 years, after mounting losses at Merrill Lynch. Citigroup has lost $28.5 billion in the last 15 months, hammered by bad debts and toxic assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each bank has already received $45 billion in government aid in recent months and a backstop on losses related to toxic values. The aid exceeds the banks' current market value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are still in the middle of a severe banking and financial market crisis -- and it's getting worse,&quot; said Nouriel Roubini, a prominent New York University economist who forecast much of the credit and housing recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring $10 million of Citigroup debt for five years rose to $475,000 annually from $405,000 on Thursday, according to data from Phoenix Partners Group. The cost of insuring Bank of America debt rose to $275,000 a year from $245,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'STRESS TEST' DUE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In coming weeks, the U.S. Treasury is expected to subject up to 25 banks, with assets exceeding $100 billion each, to &quot;stress tests&quot; to decide which need additional capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nationalization of a bank need not be a permanent issue, Roubini added. However, he said, &quot;we have to take over some banks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodd agreed it may be necessary to nationalize some banks for a short time, although he acknowledged the government was trying to avoid that action, according to an interview with Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the Obama administration believed that &quot;a privately held banking system is the correct way to go.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for nationalization seems to be growing, even among some Republicans. Sen. Lindsey Graham, considered one of the Senate's more conservative members, said recently that nationalization could be an option and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said government intervention could be the least bad alternative left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said in New York that there is nothing wrong with nationalizing financial institutions that have &quot;defaulted and failed&quot; and added that world leaders are committed to preventing another failure of a major bank as happened to Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman's September bankruptcy filing helped trigger a meltdown at American International Group Inc that essentially nationalized the insurer and is widely believed to have helped worsen the stock market's tailspin last fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last July, the former Bush administration and the Federal Reserve effectively nationalized mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a bid to back the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis was subpoenaed last week by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who is investigating whether the bank broke the law by not telling shareholders about big Merrill Lynch losses, a person familiar with the situation said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State investigators are probing whether trading losses were adequately disclosed to shareholders, who were asked to approve the deal in December, and to the boards of both companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuomo also is asking what top executives who approved the bonuses knew about the losses, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a related development, Cuomo's office took testimony from former Merrill CEO John Thain in an all-day session on Thursday, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thain was asked about $4 billion in bonuses paid to Merrill employees and why Bank of America's merger agreement with Merrill contained a secret attachment outlining the maximum Merrill could pay, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News that Merrill paid bonuses, despite nearly collapsing this year and posting $15.3 billion in fourth-quarter losses, sparked outrage among investors and government officials. Merrill awarded bonuses in December, a month earlier than it did in past years and just before the deal with Bank of America closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuomo's office declined to comment. Bank of America and a Thain spokesman did not immediately return calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America acquired the nation's largest brokerage on January 1. Two weeks later, Bank of America revealed that Merrill lost $15.3 billion in the fourth quarter and announced a second U.S. government capital infusion of $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America shares dropped 14 percent to $3.93 on Thursday amid fears that losses from Merrill, credit card-related problems, recently acquired mortgage lender Countrywide Financial and other areas could lead to a takeover by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Well-off Venezuelans say Chavez led them to Stanford</title>

<description><![CDATA[CARACAS (Reuters) - Droves of middle-class and well-heeled Venezuelans invested with Texan financier Allen Stanford, who is accused of "massive fraud," because they say they feared their money was not safe at home under socialist President Hugo Chavez.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J2US20090220</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Frank Jack Daniel and Brian Ellsworth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Droves of middle-class and well-heeled Venezuelans invested with Texan financier Allen Stanford, who is accused of &quot;massive fraud,&quot; because they say they feared their money was not safe at home under socialist President Hugo Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan money is estimated to represent more than one-quarter of the $8 billion that U.S. investigators say was invested in fraudulent Stanford certificates of deposit with impossibly high interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government seized Stanford's local commercial bank, a small operation holding local currency accounts, on Thursday after a run by customers using Internet facilities. The government promised to auction off the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many wealthy and middle-class Venezuelans say they are intimidated by Chavez, who often characterizes the rich as bad people and has imposed tough limits on currency flows and periodically expropriates companies and land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But individuals in the oil-exporting nation who got their fingers burned by Allen Stanford, a 58-year-old billionaire, now have a new problem. Venezuela's banking regulator estimates they may have had more than $2 billion invested in his offshore companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We love that Stanford man like we love Chavez,&quot; one well-dressed young investor said bitterly, smoking at a Stanford office, where hundreds have lined up in recent days seeking their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a major banking collapse in the 1990s, Venezuelans started to keep their savings offshore, even before Chavez became president. With many of the wealthy scared that his socialist revolution would one day make them flee the country, they decided that building up savings overseas was indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the time comes to run from Venezuela it's important to have something outside,&quot; said Monica Pena, who had invested her parents' inheritance in Stanford because of its high rates and marble and dark wood-paneled offices suggesting respectability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation in South America's top oil exporter is higher than savings rates, and many see the dollar as a safe-haven currency. Chavez, an ally of Cuba, exacerbates the anxiety with actions against the private sector such as nationalizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Where are you going to take your two cents? You can't trust the banks here, and you don't want to have much money here because this government wants to take it,&quot; said one investor whose family entrusted about $250,000 to Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This lunatic we have here makes you feel like your money is running through your fingers,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many investors asked not to be named because they feared they would be identified as wealthy and targeted by criminals or even by the government for higher taxes. Some worried they might suffer reprisals from the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI IN CARACAS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford employed trusted figures to sell his investment scheme in Venezuela including respected local bankers. For several years, Luis Giusti, a former head of state-oil company PDVSA and a high-profile Chavez opponent, was a member of the advisory board of Stanford Financial Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in Venezuela after the bank crisis, Stanford sales began slowly in a simple office, but soon snowballed as clients, happy with high-interest gains, brought in friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank offered a 24-hour service and allowed investors to withdraw dollar-denominated checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limits on buying and selling foreign currency, many Venezuelans used black-market third parties to convert their bolivars before they invested in Stanford's dollar-denominated accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was as if this branch in Caracas was actually located in Miami,&quot; said one Stanford client who invested for 14 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors gathered at Stanford International Bank's Caracas offices on Thursday fretted that the government would take an interest in the overseas investment operation and find out people had sidestepped currency controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lots of people are worried the government will come in and ask where their million dollar deposit came from,&quot; said a client with a 14-year history with Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another concern for Venezuelan investors is that the government could make them repatriate any money recovered from Stanford at the official exchange rate, increasing losses.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Joseph Nasr and Douglas Hamilton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Right-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday accepted a mandate to form Israel's next government and immediately called for a broad, national unity coalition with centrist and left-wing partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a coalition might create a stable, middle-of-the-road government immune to the sort of pressure from fringe parties that has hamstrung previous Israeli administrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was no sign that his rivals would accept, and Netanyahu may have no alternative but an alliance with far-right and ultra-religious parties, which could tie his hands on making peace with the Palestinians and tightening fiscal discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinians and Arab neighbors were likely to see his nomination as confirmation that most Israelis are in no hurry to pursue peace deals with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu, 59, leads the hawkish Likud party. He was prime minister before in the late 1990s and now has six weeks to put together a coalition for a second turn at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likud more than doubled its seats in the election 10 days ago in which the security of the Jewish state was the paramount issue, after a 2006 conflict with Hezbollah Islamists in Lebanon and a war with Islamist Palestinian Hamas in Gaza last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was no clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 27 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Netanyahu ended up one seat behind the centrist Kadima party of Tzipi Livni, the dominant partner in the outgoing coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electorate's rightward drift, however, gave him a better chance of achieving a majority with like-minded parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But his nomination by President Shimon Peres on Friday was a break with Israeli tradition, which has always given a governing mandate to the leader of the first-placed party after elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu urged his opponents to close ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I call on Kadima chairwoman Tzipi Livni and Labor Party chairman Ehud Barak and I say to them -- let's unite to secure the future of the State of Israel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeating his campaign message, he said Iran was seeking nuclear weapons that could threaten Israel and was challenging Israel through Islamist proxies, Hezbollah in south Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Gaza Strip, a spokesman for the ruling Palestinian Hamas movement predicted conflict and instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This means that Zionist policy is going from bad to worse,&quot; he said. &quot;The nomination of Netanyahu does not point to security, peace or stability in the days ahead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KADIMA SPLIT OVER GRAND COALITION&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Livni, 50, said on Friday she was not interested in joining Netanyahu in any coalition &quot;that doesn't allow me to pursue my path, the path of Kadima as we promised the voters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoel Hasson, who leads Kadima's parliamentary group, told Reuters the party's lawmakers would meet on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I imagine the decision will be that we are going into opposition,&quot; he said. &quot;We won't enter any government headed by Netanyahu.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some in Kadima urged Livni to negotiate a coalition with Netanyahu, and the two may meet on Sunday after Netanyahu telephone to invite her for talks, party officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We didn't go to the elections in order to sit in opposition,&quot; Parliament Speaker Dalia Itzik of Kadima said told Channel 2 television. &quot;I hope very much we can set up a government where Kadima has a central role.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu's rivals to the left favor pursuing talks with secular Palestinian leaders, backed by U.S. President Barack Obama, that could hand most of the occupied West Bank and parts of Jerusalem to a new Palestinian state in return for peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-educated Netanyahu, who had poor ties with the Clinton administration as premier, says Israel's unilateral ceding of occupied Arab land, notably Gaza in 2005, has backfired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't see much (peace) progress happening regardless of which coalition he forms,&quot; said analyst Eliezer Don-Yehiya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepting his mandate, Netanyahu also noted that &quot;the most serious world economic crisis in 80 years threatens the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Israelis.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former finance minister championed welfare cuts and free-market practices in the early part of this decade, but to close a coalition deal with smaller parties he may have to agree to budget for more social benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Frankfurt-listed shares of U.S. banks Citigroup and Bank of America fell on Friday, with traders and analysts citing fears that big U.S. banks could be nationalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 1130 GMT, Citigroup shares were down 6.4 percent in Frankfurt and Bank of America traded 8.0 percent lower. Spokesmen for both banks in London declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for the banks in New York were unavailable for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;People believe that big U.S. banks will be nationalized as will a lot of western banks in general, and that there will be a lot of capital raising to come,&quot; said Mark Sartori, head of trading at Fox-Pitt, Kelton in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Wealth in a global daily note said falling bond yields in the United States &quot;probably reflect a rumor in markets that two American banks risk being nationalized overnight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - General Motors' Saab estimates that it made a loss of around 3 billion crowns ($340 million) last year and would run a similar loss this year, the carmaker said in documents submitted to a court on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saab Automobile said earlier on Friday it would file for reorganization with a local Swedish court, a legal procedure to give it protection from creditors while it seeks funding from both public and private sources and restructures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The estimated, still unaudited loss for 2008 amounts to 3 billion crowns. The current outlook for 2009 suggests a similar level of losses and associated funding requirements,&quot; Saab said in the document filed with the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company said GM had notified the company that it would not fund further projected losses at Saab, but that it would provide liquidity for the company to pursue a reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The Swedish government has not closed the door to providing loan guarantees to Saab following a restructuring of General Motors' loss-making Swedish carmaker, a senior official told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is not the case that we have closed the door to that. That will depend on what the plans look like,&quot; said Joran Hagglund, state secretary at the Swedish Industry Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hagglund said he could not say what specific conditions the government would demand to provide loan guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The general demand is that there must exist sufficient collateral,&quot; he said. &quot;If you provide loan guarantees to someone, you must be sure the company has a future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saab Automobile said earlier on Friday it would file for a reorganization plan, a Swedish legal procedure which would give it protection from creditors. The company said it would seek funding from both public and private sources.&lt;/p&gt;</media:text>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Following are key facts about Saab Automobile, a wholly-owned subsidiary since 2000 of General Motors Corp which said the Swedish carmaker could file for reorganization as early as this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Headquarters: Trollhattan, southwest Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Financials: 2007 operating loss of 2.19 billion Swedish crowns ($248 million loss), after a 2.90 billion loss in 2006, according to the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Saab Automobile has not made a profit since 2001. (GM does not report Saab financials separately.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Employees: 4,108 at the end of 2008, of which 3,717 in Trollhattan. 2,059 blue-collar workers are employed at the Trollhattan factory.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Veronica Ek and Victoria Klesty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TROLLHATTEN, Sweden (Reuters) - Loss-making Nordic carmaker Saab's fight for survival moved up a gear on Friday as the General Motors unit won protection from creditors while it tries to find a new partner and raise fresh funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM, itself facing mountainous debts and an uncertain future, refuses to continue funding Saab's losses. In a plan submitted to the U.S. Treasury this week, GM said the Swedish firm would become an independent business as of January 1, 2010..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saab said it lost about 3 billion crowns ($340 million) in 2008, according to documents filed with the Swedish court that granted the company a stay of execution. It expects a similar loss this year, blaming slack demand, aging products, overcapacity and high costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company -- which has been making cars in the industrial town of Trollhatten in the southwest of the country since 1949 -- is one of Sweden's best-known brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it said it needed a rapid restructuring in order to address the level of near-term losses and new funding from either private or public sources to launch more competitive models, and that it had to find a new partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by new and vintage Saabs in the company's museum showcasing its six decades of car making, Chief Executive Jan-Ake Jonsson said that making Saab increasingly independent of its U.S. parent would help it find external financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even though we have not been actively searching for new partners, we have had many knocking on our door showing interest in Saab,&quot; he told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am very confident and I think we have a solid basis for solving this financing issue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STATE AID&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any restructuring would need the approval of Saab's creditors, who will meet on April 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its court filing, Saab said GM has said it &quot;would not fund further the projected losses,&quot; but would provide liquidity while the company restructures. It was not immediately clear whether GM would cover this year's projected loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swedish daily Dagens Industri said on Friday that GM is prepared to pump in $400 million into Saab if the Swedish state guarantees a further loan of $590 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many analysts believe such sums would be far too little to turn Saab around, and question whether the brand has a realistic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweden said late last year it would provide its vehicle industry with up to 25 billion crowns in aid to help it through the global economic crisis, mainly in the shape of loan guarantees. Jonsson said Saab expected to be given access to the state funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are waiting for a reply from the government,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swedish Industry Minister Maud Olofsson said the information received about Saab's situation on Friday was not enough for the Swedish government to provide the carmaker with loan guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have had a discussion with GM today and I have told GM we have doubts about this business plan,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM must demonstrate how they planned to make Saab profitable and that they would contribute the resources needed for the Swedish company to launch new car models, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;These are questions that demand answers if they are looking for a guarantee from the state,&quot; she told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saab and rival car firm Volvo have helped shape Sweden's image abroad with their focus on safety, family motoring and high engineering standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the current economic crisis has plunged the auto industry worldwide into crisis, adding to problems for carmakers in countries with high production costs such as Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volvo Cars has been put up for sale by owner Ford Motor Co. . Saab and Volvo employ more than 20,000 people in Sweden with thousands more jobs at suppliers tied to the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;People definitely view this as a better option than a bankruptcy,&quot; Saab worker Mats Roos said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you ask those who are inside right now, in the factory, they have a positive view on this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in Swedish auto industry suppliers fell sharply, however, on concern over possible fallout from Saab's woes. Autoliv, the world's biggest seat belt and airbag maker, fell nearly 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearing firm SKF was down 3.3 percent. SKF said it had minimal exposure to Saab. &quot;But even if the firm is a small client, it is a valuable client and even small volumes are important,&quot; SKF spokesman Ingalill Ostman said.

<title>Swiss bank shares tumble as UBS tax probe widens</title>

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J18920090220</guid>
<media:content url="http://www.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20090220&amp;t=2&amp;i=8337511&amp;w="  type="video/x-flv"  expression="full"  medium="video" ></media:content>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Jucca and Stephanie Nebehay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZURICH/GENEVA (Reuters) - Shares in UBS hit record lows on Friday as Swiss bank stocks reeled on concern a widening U.S. tax probe will weaken strict privacy rules that underpin Switzerland's wealth management industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS, the world's biggest banker to the rich, led the fall in Swiss bank shares. It was down 12.5 percent at 10:14 a.m. EDT after hitting a fresh all-time low at 10.54 Swiss francs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in rivals Credit Suisse and Julius Baer, both large players in the private banking industry which has thrived thanks to Swiss bank privacy laws, were down 9 and 10 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss banks were underperforming a fall in the DJ Stoxx index of European banks, which was down 5.4 percent. Bank worries also hit the Swiss franc, down almost 1 percent against the dollar and 0.6 percent against the euro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crisis-hit UBS late on Wednesday settled U.S. criminal charges that it had helped rich Americans to dodge taxes. But U.S. tax authorities said on Thursday they were still pursuing a civil lawsuit seeking to access details of 52,000 UBS clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is very unfair to see that the whole profession has been dragged through the mud,&quot; Ivan Pictet, senior managing partner and scion of one of Switzerland's largest private banks, said in an interview with the Geneva daily Le Temps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The reputation of the whole (Swiss) financial center has been tarnished by the fault of a single banking institution,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a very annoying precedent for Switzerland.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite tough Swiss laws protecting bank clients, the government said on Thursday it had no choice but to let UBS hand over data to avoid U.S. criminal charges which could have threatened the bank's existence and hurt the Swiss economy, heavily dependent on the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Swiss made a mistake, they believed that in caving in... that things would come to an end,&quot; Douglas Hornung, a Geneva lawyer who represents American clients of UBS who are under U.S. investigation, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;They have now discovered with shock that it continues and the whole Swiss financial center is in danger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS agreed on Wednesday to pay a fine of $780 million and to disclose about 250 names of U.S. clients it said had committed tax fraud. But U.S. tax authorities now want thousands more names of its citizens it says are hiding about $14.8 billion in assets in secret Swiss bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRESSURE MOUNTS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly a third of the wealth that is stashed in tax havens around the world is in Swiss banks -- an estimated $2.2 trillion -- making the Alpine state the world's biggest offshore center. Other havens include Liechtenstein, Bermuda and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tax-dodging schemes are increasingly under attack by governments scrambling to find revenue needed to finance the soaring costs of government stimulus programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Christensen, director of the Tax Justice Network which campaigns against bank secrecy, said he also saw a dramatic shift in public opinion against tax havens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is clear to many that the game is over, the game pretending this is a minor issue,&quot; he said. &quot;Wealth management has become an euphemism for tax evasion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue will be on the agenda at a meeting of European leaders in Berlin at the weekend to prepare for the April G20 summit on reforming global financial rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German government said on Friday it had taken note of the UBS settlement and said it will continue to push for the implementation of international standards on tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany, which paid an informant last year to obtain names of German clients hiding funds in LGT bank of Liechtenstein, is now investigating Prince Max of Liechtenstein for possible tax evasion, the Financial Times Deutschland reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LGT said in a statement that Prince Max, the bank's CEO who lives in Munich and is the second son of current ruler Hans Adam II, had complied with Germany tax rules and was cooperating with authorities in the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switzerland's European Union neighbors are also watching the development of the UBS case and are hoping that cooperation with the U.S. authorities will set a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would expect that similar requests from EU member states would by no means be treated differently,&quot; said a spokeswoman for EU Tax Commissioner Laszlo Kovacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Farrugia, General Manager of Valetta Fund Services in Malta which caters for onshore and offshore clients, said the U.S. investigation had ramifications far beyond UBS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;UBS is not reliant on investors from the U.S., or even on private banking. The stability of UBS is not in question,&quot; he said. &quot;The question is how will this affect U.S. customers of other Swiss banks?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS shares had rallied on Thursday on hopes the settlement would end uncertainties hanging over the company, which has written down more toxic assets than any other European bank during the credit crisis, prompting clients to loose confidence and withdraw billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Struggling automaker General Motors, which is asking the U.S. government for more help, is seeking buyers for assets, including Swedish brand Saab, and has said it needs to cut $1.2 billion of costs in Europe to return its business there to profit by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some details about the profitability of European automobile brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPEL/VAUXHALL (GENERAL MOTORS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group posted an operating margin of -11.8 percent for the nine months through September 30. It does not break down its results by individual brand, which in Europe include Germany's Opel and the UK's Vauxhall Motors. Its GM Europe operations posted an operating margin of -3.4 percent, compared with -15.7 percent for GM North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAAB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweden's Saab Automobile, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM, has not made a profit since 2001. GM does not report Saab financials separately but the Swedish Companies Registration Office data showed it made an operating loss of 2.19 billion Swedish crowns ($251.7 million) in 2007, and a 2.90 billion Swedish crown loss in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PORSCHE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porsche posted a 115 percent operating margin for the 12 months to July 30 2008, benefiting from a one-time gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAIMLER&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany's Daimler posted an earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin of 2.8 percent for the full year 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its vans and buses divisions posted the best margins, at 8.6 percent and 8.4 percent respectively. Trucks saw an EBIT margin of 5.6 percent while its Mercedes-Benz car brand posted an EBIT margin of 4.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VOLKSWAGEN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen recorded a group operating margin for the nine months to September 30 of 5.8 percent. Volkswagen brand passenger cars' margin reached 3.4 percent. The group's Spain-based SEAT brand had an operating margin of -0.7 percent while the Czech Republic's Skoda posted 7.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Audi brand recorded an 8.0 percent operating margin, while luxury brand Bentley's margin was 8.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BMW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German group's operating margin was 4.1 percent for the nine-months to the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIAT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiat Group, including CNH tractors and Iveco trucks, posted a trading profit -- operating profit excluding extraordinary costs like restructuring of 3.4 billion euros ($4.28 billion) on net revenues of 59.4 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automobile division, which includes the Fiat, Lancia and loss-making Alfa Romeo brands, saw a trading profit of 691 million euros on net revenues of 26.9 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The luxury Ferrari brand's trading profit reached 339 million euros on 1.9 billion euro sales, while Maserati's trading profit was 72 million euros on sales of 825 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French group PSA Peugeot Citroen recorded a 3.6 percent margin for 2008. Its automotive division achieved a margin of 2.6 percent. The group does not publish separate margins for its Peugeot and Citroen brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RENAULT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France's Renault's automobile division recorded a -0.8 percent operating margin from its automobile division, compared with 0.6 percent for the group as a whole in 2008, including its financing division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;($1=8.701 Swedish Crown)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;($1=.7938 Euro)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. consumer prices seen up in January</title>

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J1BP20090220</guid>
<media:content url="http://www.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20090220&amp;t=2&amp;i=8339950&amp;w="  type="image/jpeg"  expression="full"  medium="image" ></media:content>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Ellen Freilich&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices are estimated to have risen in January as a recent rise in energy prices defied the economic downturn and disinflationary trends, according to economists polled by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As energy prices rose, a median forecast culled from a poll of more than 70 economists estimated that consumer prices overall rose 0.3 percent in January from December, while prices excluding food and energy items rose 0.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A poll of more than 40 economists offered a median forecast for a year-over-year 0.2 percent drop in consumer prices in January. Core consumer prices were estimated up 1.5 percent from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher energy prices also played a role in producer prices last month when those prices rose 0.8 percent after falling for five straight months, according to a Labor Department report. Analysts said, however, that inflation was not a realistic threat this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A very modest rebound in retail gasoline prices is behind the headline PPI and CPI price index increases, but the key theme for 2009 for these reports is going to be disinflation - if not deflation - rather than inflation,&quot; said Deutsche Bank Securities senior economist Carl Riccadonna in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CPI report is due at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sampling of forecasts and analysis on the upcoming consumer price data follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecast: Consumer Price Index +0.2 percent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;core Consumer Price Index +0.1 percent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The core figure reflects a very restrained rise in service prices, particularly in the housing area. Buyer resistance to higher prices is keeping core goods prices flat. It does look as if energy prices, i.e. gasoline, bounced up a bit which is why the total CPI will rise more than the core figure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONRAD DeQUADROS, ECONOMIST, RDQ ECONOMICS, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecast: Consumer Price Index +0.4 percent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;core Consumer Price Index +0.1 percent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We expect a 0.1 percent rise in the core CPI which is a little bit above the recent flat trend tied to discounting in autos, airfares and hotels. That discounting might have run its course because energy prices leveled out and started to rise. So the factors holding down core CPI may have eased and that will give us a slightly larger core CPI increase in January than what we saw toward the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the headline CPI, gasoline prices at the retail level are also reported to have increased, even if not as much as they did at the wholesale level. But an approximately 6 percent increase in retail gasoline prices would add 0.3 (percentage point) to the headline CPI, creating a headline CPI reading of 0.4 percent. &quot;People may see some upside risk to the CPI as well, given what happened to the January PPI. But the extreme level of stress in the economy is likely to prevent price increases at the consumer level in the near term.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecast: Consumer Price Index +0.2 percent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;core Consumer Price Index +0.1 percent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We estimate that gasoline prices rose to a national average of $1.84/gallon in January, up more than 5 percent from $1.74/gallon in December. This gain is expected to overwhelm continued declines in the other CPI energy components. Food prices are also forecast to bounce back slightly after a surprisingly weak reading last month (note that annual adjustment to the CPI seasonal factors on Wednesday may affect our headline forecast).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The core CPI is forecast to increase by 0.1 percent after remaining roughly unchanged over the past three months. We believe the very low readings in Q4 exaggerated the underlying trend in inflation due to negative passthrough effects from record declines in energy prices (through airline fares, for example) and exceptionally low rent inflation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>At small Antigua accounting firm: Who's Stanford?</title>

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51I5XK20090220</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jason Szep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (Reuters) - One man at the Antiguan firm that Texas billionaire Allen Stanford claimed as an auditor might have been able to shed light on the fraud accusations against the tycoon. But he's dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other staff don't even seem to know Stanford. Two people in charge at C.A.S. Hewlett &amp;amp; Co, identified by Stanford as auditors of his offshore bank, told a Reuters reporter on Thursday there was no evidence of any ties to the 58-year-old financier and sports entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who would know, according to current manager Eugene Perry, is former chief executive Charlesworth &quot;Shelley&quot; Hewlett. He died January 1 at age 73, staff at the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perry said he never met Stanford in his 10 years at the firm. While speaking with a Reuters reporter in the late Hewlett's personal office, Perry telephoned a woman he identified as the company's current leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are not privy to any information about any relationship with Stanford,&quot; said the woman, who would only identify herself as Celia. Asked if she was aware of any files at the firm associated with Stanford, she said she was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hewlett's daughter, named Celia, took over responsibility for the accounting firm from London after her father died. It couldn't be determined if the Celia interviewed by telephone was the late Hewlett's daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal agents on Thursday served Stanford with a complaint from U.S. regulators accusing the Texan of operating an $8 billion fraud centered on the sale of high-yielding certificates of deposit offered by Stanford International Bank Ltd (SIB), his Antiguan affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest in Stanford has extended across the Atlantic. Britain's Serious Fraud Office said Thursday it was monitoring a possible link between the accounting firm and Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a situation where there is the possibility there may be a UK link, and so we are monitoring the situation,&quot; a spokesman for the SFO said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not the case that we have launched investigators at it. We are making contact and liaising with other authorities,&quot; the spokesman added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.A.S. Hewlett has offices at several London addresses, but the phone numbers were either disconnected or rang unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two people with neighboring businesses in Enfield, a residential suburb north of London, told Reuters that C.A.S. Hewlett had had a small office in the building on Southbury Road, but that the employees left about four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANYBODY HOME?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in its court complaint that it had tried several times to contact C.A.S. Hewlett during its investigation, but &quot;no one ever answered the phone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The midyear report of Stanford's Antiguan affiliate, released in June, identified C.A.S. Hewlett as its auditors. The SEC also listed the firm as Stanford's auditor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the 10 workers in the Hewlett office in a quiet, largely residential neighborhood in the capital, seemed an unlikely operation to manage books for an $8 billion enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During two visits over two days by a Reuters reporter, no one staffed a sparse reception desk in the aquamarine building. On one visit to the reception area that lasted nearly two hours, there was no senior manager in the building. The occasional sound of reggae music wafted from inside the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.A.S. Hewlett is listed on the British Commonwealth's website as a &quot;financial services partner&quot; in Antigua with an offshore client portfolio that includes banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions and intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlesworth Hewlett was born in 1936, according to the website, and qualified as an accountant in 1970 after attending South West London College. He also is said to have served in the Britain's Royal Air Force and earned a medal for active service in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stanford's reappearance brings relief to his folks</title>

<description><![CDATA[MEXIA, TEXAS (Reuters) - When Billie Stanford heard that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had found her stepson Allen Stanford, the billionaire Texan facing a federal fraud charge, she and her husband thanked God.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51J0KI20090220</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Robert MacMillan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXIA, TEXAS (Reuters) - When Billie Stanford heard that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had found her stepson Allen Stanford, the billionaire Texan facing a federal fraud charge, she and her husband thanked God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is one relief off of our minds. We're so pleased and thankful to the Lord that he's alive, and healthy, I'm sure,&quot; Stanford, 73, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now begins the hard part. Stanford faces U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accusations that he engaged in an $8 billion fraud. The SEC has charged Stanford, two of his colleagues and three of his companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His parents do not believe that Stanford defrauded investors, but they cannot say that it did not happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can't believe that he has, but I won't say 'no,'&quot; said James Stanford, 81, sitting at his desk in a small office in the east-central Texas town of Mexia (Muh-HAY-uh), where Allen Stanford was raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'll defend him. We love him and support him, but he should do the right thing and come forward,&quot; the elder Stanford said. &quot;Don't run and hide. God damn, don't do that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Thursday, Stanford's father said he knew nothing about the SEC's accusations against his son. He said he did not know where Allen was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, FBI agents found Stanford in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Billie Stanford said that he had not yet called his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Stanford, chairman emeritus of Stanford Group Co, has received a subpoena and is due to testify for the SEC next week in Waco, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STANFORD EMPIRE STARTED IN 1932&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Allen turned it into an empire, the company, founded in 1932 by James' father Lodis, sold insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen took over in 1993. His father has participated in board meetings, but is not involved in day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another board member who served in a similar capacity is former Mexia car dealer Oliver Goswick. Goswick, known as &quot;O.Y.,&quot; lives in Mexia with his family. He has also been subpoenaed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His son, Richard Goswick, said that neither James Stanford nor his father would have known what Allen Stanford was doing as head of the Stanford International Bank (SIB). SIB is based on the West Indies island Antigua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard said that James and his father served as board members in an essentially honorary capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said of his father: &quot;If he thought there was anything wrong, he would have divorced himself from the relationship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;These are churchgoing, small-town people,&quot; said Richard Goswick, 63, who owns the Dick Scott Ford dealership in Mexia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.Y. Goswick was a General Motors serviceman and an auto dealer proprietor after leaving the U.S. Air Force, his son said. He said his father had a high school education and was not a sophisticated financier. &quot;His mental capacity at his prime could never conceive of something of this nature,&quot; he said, referring to the alleged fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Goswick suffered a stroke and his health has worsened since then, his son said. He cannot communicate, and can walk only short distances. His son has a doctor's note explaining the elder Goswick's condition, and he plans to send it to the SEC. First, he said, he must hire a lawyer for his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goswick said he had met Allen Stanford occasionally over the years, and considered him an intelligent, charismatic man who dressed well and ran a company with an eye on cleanliness as well as success. &quot;You couldn't even be employed by Allen if you smoked,&quot; he said, adding that even the hangar where Stanford's planes were stored, was immaculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NO GLITZ AT MEXIA OFFICE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building is simple, white walled with low ceilings and a gabled roof. Like Mexia, there is nothing flashy. James Stanford wore a black suit jacket, blue shirt and black pants when we met at his one-floor office there. He uses a walker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wears a brace on his neck and his head leans forward when he speaks, but his sharp eyes really do all the talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James said his office has no dealings with Stanford's business. Instead, it is a place for him to go besides home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James has been working there for 25 years. A picture of him and his son, smiling in the same office, hangs on a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said he was asked not to talk to the press, but he did not say by whom. He has been giving interviews anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James said he knew nothing of his son's business dealings today. But, in the late 1990s, he said, a Mexican customer of Stanford put $3 million into the bank for investment purposes. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents then approached Allen Stanford and said the money was from a Mexican drug cartel and had been laundered several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James said that Allen had told the board about this, and that he had &quot;refunded&quot; the money to the U.S. Treasury. He said: &quot;Allen worked with them, hand in glove.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time he spoke to his son, he said, was a week ago. James said that during that conversation, Allen intimated that the company was in trouble, but he would only tell his father to read The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NO HOMETOWN HERO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a town of fewer than 11,000 people, residents know who Allen Stanford is, but most do not know him well. He left with his mother when he was 9 years old after she and James Stanford divorced. He graduated from high school in Fort Worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After starting a health club in Waco that failed, Stanford left the United States, Richard Goswick said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said Allen Stanford then met a lawyer with connections in Antigua, where Stanford now has dual citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford bought many houses and apartments, flipped them for higher prices and worked his way into serious money in Houston. The metropolis lies about 165 miles and a world away from the dusty, sparsely populated streets and many empty brick front stores of Mexia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Wright, editor of the Mexico News, said Allen Stanford &quot;always had an entrepreneurial spirit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That included selling his old bicycle to his neighbor, Jo Bennett, when they were both about 10 years old, Bennett, 58, recalled. &quot;We were just little kids.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though few say they know Allen Stanford well, the Stanford family's history is intertwined with the history of Mexia. James Stanford served several terms as the town's mayor. Even when Allen Stanford's mother sold her house, the real estate agency that Bennett works for handled the sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for visiting his parents and helping his mother to sell her house a month or two ago, Allen Stanford has not been much of a presence in Mexia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not that many people knew him,&quot; said Dick Flatt of Flatt Stationers Inc. &quot;Stories would come from time to time over the wire about how he done good, made another million in Houston.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We thought maybe he was down in Venezuela somewhere,&quot; he said, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Friday that North Korea should refrain from provocative actions and statements if it wants a better relationship with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are key quotes from Clinton at a news conference with South Korea's Foreign Minister:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ON NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Republic of Korea's achievement of democracy and prosperity stands in stark contrast to the tyranny and poverty across the border to the North.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;North Korea is not going to get a different relationship with the United States while insulting and refusing dialogue with the Republic of Korea.&quot; &quot;... we are asking the govt of North Korea to refrain from the provocative and unhelpful war of words it has been engaged in.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ON SIX-PARTY TALKS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;(We will) try to convince the North Koreans to begin a process within the six-party talks toward the complete and verifiable elimination of nuclear weapons.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;... we deal with the government in place right now, and that government is being asked to re-engage in the six-party talks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;(We) will be discussing what ways we can best approach North Korea so that we present a united front with respect to all of the issues that are of concern but the most immediate issue is to continue the disablement of their nuclear facilities and to get a complete and verifiable agreement as to the end of their nuclear program.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ON A POSSIBLE NORTH KOREAN MISSILE TEST&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;...it is clear that (under a U.N. resolution) North Korea is required to suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program. The North should refrain from violating this resolution and also from any and all activities that could harm the six-party talks and aggravate tensions in the region.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</media:text>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Chris Baltimore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - For clients, doing business with Allen Stanford got you a personalized parking spot and a 5-star meal. For top-performing employees, it was a ticket to meet Sir Allen himself and see the world through a champagne glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few have ever gained access to the plush Stanford Group offices in Houston's upscale Galleria area, the U.S. headquarters where the Texas billionaire carried out what the Securities and Exchange Commission called a &quot;massive ongoing fraud&quot; through the sale of $8 billion in high yield certificates of deposit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Mark Tidwell, 40, a former senior vice president at Stanford, who has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the company, recalls a plush dining room with a new menu every day, and perks aplenty for employees fortunate enough to make the &quot;Top Producers Club.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know it's different when you pull in because there is a security guard that greets every car that pulls into the parking garage,&quot; Tidwell told Reuters in an interview at a Houston law office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential clients arriving at Stanford's Houston office found a parking space with their name on it and were met at the door. Once inside the confines of the building, bedecked outside with palm trees and tropical flowers, there were dark granite floors and a sea of mahogany walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they were ushered to the auditorium to watch a 10-minute video about the history of the company -- which traces its roots back to the Great Depression -- clients might have walked by Stanford's personal office, also on the first floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Tidwell despite being a senior executive never got invited into Allen Stanford's inner sanctum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;No one really gets to go in there but it's about half of the first floor,&quot; Tidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not to worry. After watching the video, potential clients were led to the a private dining room called the Eagle Room, which featured a different menu every day, white linen tablecloths and award-winning chefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is a lot of direct attention being given to folks,&quot; Tidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. law enforcement officials found Stanford in the Fredericksburg, Virginia, area on Thursday, and served the jet-setting 58-year-old tycoon with a complaint accusing him of the fraud. He was knighted by Antigua and Barbuda in 2006 to become Sir Allen Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford's financial empire is now in the hands of a judge-appointed receiver, after federal agents raided Stanford Group offices in Houston, Miami and other U.S. cities earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen Stanford himself interacted with employees occasionally but &quot;it is brief, it is limited,&quot; said Charles Rawl, who is also a part of the whistleblower lawsuit along with Tidwell. &quot;He didn't want to have much to do with us,&quot; said Rawl, who was a financial adviser with Stanford Group Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, the two say they were forced to resign to avoid participating in illegal business practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tidwell, who sold investments for the Antiguan-based Stanford International Bank, said he had more interactions with Stanford because the banking arm of the businesses was &quot;his baby.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford personally attended most meetings of the &quot;Top Producers Club,&quot; which convened in cities across the world to toast the company's top sellers, Tidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their elegance, the meetings, which occurred in cities like Geneva, New York, Houston and the Mexican resort town of Puerto Vallarta, were &quot;borderline on Disneyworld,&quot; Tidwell said. He said he eventually stopped attending the meetings because they had low business value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was really an opportunity to brag and talk about how everybody did for that particular quarter,&quot; Tidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jack Kim and Arshad Mohammed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday told North Korea to stop being provocative and return to nuclear talks, warning that ties could not improve ties with Washington if it continued insulting South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton, calling the isolated state a &quot;tyranny,&quot; repeated the new U.S. administration's offer of diplomatic relations, massive aid and a peace treaty if Pyongyang gives up efforts to build an atomic arsenal, which poses one of the biggest risks to security in North Asia and its giant economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most immediate issue is to continue the disablement of their nuclear facilities and to get a complete and verifiable agreement as to the end of their nuclear program,&quot; she told a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talks between the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States on the North's nuclear ambitions have all but ground to a halt, most recently stuck on Pyongyang's refusal to allow nuclear material to be taken abroad for tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton made clear the North also needed to tone down its increasingly furious rhetoric which this week alone has included a threat of war with its wealthy neighbor South Korea and an accusation the United States plans a nuclear strike against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is also thought to be preparing the launch of a missile with the potential to reach U.S. territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;North Korea is not going to get a different relationship with the United States while insulting and refusing dialogue with (South Korea),&quot; Clinton said in Seoul, the third stop of her Asia tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She called the saber-rattling &quot;provocative&quot; and &quot;unhelpful,&quot; praising the South Korean government for its restraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea, seen facing another serious food shortage, has turned on the conservative government in the South which has ended years of free-flowing aid over the nuclear impasse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;(South) Korea's achievement of democracy and prosperity stands in stark contrast to the tyranny and poverty across the border to the North,&quot; Clinton said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea bristled at being described as &quot;an outpost of tyranny&quot; by the Bush administration, and one analyst said Clinton's comments could trigger further anger from Pyongyang's leadership which may have hoped for a softer line from the new U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;(This) is likely to lead it to a new round of harsher rhetoric or to a possible military provocations against South Korea,&quot; said Moon Hong-sik, a research fellow at the South's Institute for National Security Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POSSIBLE POWER STRUGGLE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Clinton warned of a possible power struggle in the communist state, and the possibility of a crisis over who may succeed leader Kim Jong-il, 67, who is widely believed to have suffered a stroke last August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While she was in Seoul, North Korea said a senior general and close Kim aide, O Kuk-ryol, had been promoted to a top post in the National Defence Commission, the main seat of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one of a number of recent changes in the military hierarchy and comes amid widespread speculation that Kim may be making preparations for his succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is thought to have largely recovered from his illness, but is reported to have a number of chronic health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation has focused on one of his sons or his brother-in-law could be groomed to take over Asia's only communist dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Clinton said Washington was dealing with the government in power and asked it to fulfill its nuclear agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Obama administration will be willing to normalize bilateral relations, replace the peninsula's longstanding armistice agreement with a peace treaty and assist in meeting the energy and other economic and humanitarian needs of the Korean people,&quot; she said later at a women's university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton also announced her choice of Stephen Bosworth, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, to be special representative for North Korea and the nuclear talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She met also South Korean and U.S. military leaders, whose troops face the North's 1.2-million-strong army -- most of it positioned near the heavily fortified border that has divided the peninsula for about 60 years. There are about 28,000 U.S. troops to support the South's 670,000 soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton later flies to China, the nearest North Korea has to a powerful ally.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jack Kim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday raised the possibility of a power struggle in North Korea, saying &quot;the whole leadership situation is somewhat unclear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, 67, is widely believed to have suffered a stroke in August, although he appears to have recovered. Kim has given no indication who will take over in Asia's only Communist dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are profiles of some possible successors. Intelligence officials say the three men most likely to replace him are his youngest and eldest sons and a brother-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE YOUNGEST SON&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un was born in late 1983 or early 1984. The Swiss educated Jong-un is believed to be the favorite of his father, who reportedly considers him intelligent and thoughtful. Last month the South's Yonhap news agency said leader Kim had picked Jong-un to succeed him, although his youth has been cited as a problem in a society where the tradition of seniority is strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been no confirmation of the Yonhap report and intelligence officials cautioned that no candidate had emerged as the favorite. However, South Korean and Japanese media recently reported Jong-un might be nominated for a seat on the Supreme People's Assembly, the North's rubber stamp parliament, which will elect new delegates on March 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would introduce him to the North Korean public and place him in a prominent role in the leadership class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE ELDEST SON&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believe Kim Jong-nam, 37, fell out of favor when he was deported from Japan in 2001 on suspicion of trying to enter the country using a forged Dominican Republic passport in a bid to see Tokyo Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easy-going and portly Jong-nam has spoken to reporters several times over the last year, answering questions in Korean and near-perfect English. His father has often asked Jong-nam, who spends about half of his time outside of North Korea, to run tasks overseas, an intelligence source said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BROTHER-IN-LAW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jang Song-taek, 63, husband of Kim's sister and a senior communist party official, is largely expected to play a major role in the leadership that survives Kim Jong-il, possibly as a caretaker or as the outright leader. He is often seen as one of the most powerful men in the ruling party structure, although he officially holds a nominal and relatively minor post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jang has been mentioned often in North Korea's official media as joining Kim on his field visits over the past months while one of his allies was named the North's new defense minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HEAD OF STATE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Yong-nam, 81, is head of the North Korean parliament's leadership council and is the country's nominal head of state. While a long-time party member and a former foreign minister, he is not thought to have the legitimacy rooted in the North's revolutionary history, seen as necessary to become leader. If he did succeed Kim, it would likely be as a figurehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts say North Korea could move into a collective leadership when Kim Jong-il dies with one of his sons named as figurehead leader but real power held by a group of officials from the ruling Workers' Party and the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim's inner circle is dominated by cadres in their 70s and 80s who could oversee a caretaker government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MILITARY RULE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military could take over. During his 15-year rule, Kim has used the &quot;Songun&quot; or military-first doctrine to cement his grip on office, which he holds as chairman of the National Defense Commission and the 1.2 million-strong Korean People's Army, as well as head of the communist Korea Workers' Party. His dead father Kim Il-sung is officially the country's eternal president. The doctrine has given his military a strong grip on power. But the military is also seen as segmented along generational lines and divided by factions loyal to one or another of Kim's sons.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jim Wolf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FREDERICKSBURG, Virginia (Reuters) - Texas billionaire Allen Stanford has surrendered his passport in keeping with a court order, a spokesman for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday, but he was nowhere to be seen as this case played itself out on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges in Dallas, Texas, on Tuesday against Stanford, two of his colleagues and three of his companies, accusing them of an $8 billion fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford went unsighted in this historic town on Friday, a day after agents from the FBI's Richmond office, acting at the SEC's request, served him with court papers. Fredericksburg is the family home of a woman said to be Stanford's girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI served him here on Thursday with an SEC civil complaint and court orders freezing Stanford's assets and appointing a receiver, the SEC said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can confirm that all three defendants in our case have surrendered their passports,&quot; Kevin Callahan, an SEC spokesman, said in an e-mailed reply to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The co-defendants are James Davis, Stanford International Bank's chief financial officer, and Laura Pendergest-Holt, the financial group's chief investment officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passports were due to be surrendered to the clerk of the court before a scheduled hearing in Dallas on March 2, according to documents filed at the federal district court in Dallas on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until Thursday, Stanford's whereabouts had been the subject of intense speculation after he failed to respond to an SEC subpoena to answer questions about his company's operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of the day, news crews maintained a vigil outside a family home here of Andrea Stoelker, the woman reputed to be Stanford's girlfriend. But there were no signs that anyone was inside the modest, three-story, brick house on a quiet side street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late in the afternoon, a young man dressed in jeans and who looked to be in his 30s, emerged from the house and stood at the top of the front steps. When asked about Stanford's whereabouts, he said, &quot;I don't have a clue,&quot; and quickly turned to go inside. He declined to give his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stoelker is a former local resident identified in published reports as president of the board of directors of a cricket tournament that Stanford sponsored in Antigua, headquarters of his Stanford International Bank (SIB). SIB has affiliates in Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the mystery surrounding this case was an ABC News report that Stanford had retained Brendan Sullivan, a lawyer with Williams &amp;amp; Connolly, who ultimately succeeded in his defense of Oliver North in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about the report, one of Sullivan's assistants, Rhonda Meadows, told Reuters early on Friday: &quot;Mr. Sullivan has not been retained.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Ross Colvin and Jeff Mason&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday assured Canada, his country's biggest trading partner, that he would not pursue protectionist policies, and the two neighbors agreed to cooperate on cleaner energy technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama, on his first trip abroad as president, sought in talks with Prime Minister Stephen Harper to allay Canadian concerns raised by a &quot;Buy American&quot; clause in a $787 billion U.S. economic recovery plan he signed this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now is a time where we have to be very careful about any signals of protectionism,&quot; Obama told a joint news conference after several hours of talks with Harper on his one-day visit to Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;And as obviously one of the largest economies in the world, it's important for us to make sure that we are showing leadership in the belief that trade ultimately is beneficial to all countries,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stressed the United States would meet its international trade obligations and told Harper he wanted to &quot;grow trade not contract it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm quite confident that the United States will respect those obligations and continue to be a leader on the need for globalized trade,&quot; Harper said afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harper said he was willing to look at strengthening the environmental and labor provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, something Obama has said he wants. But the Canadian leader said he did not support renegotiating the agreement, which has boosted trade between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides announced they would collaborate on environmentally friendly technologies that would help them develop an electricity grid fueled by clean, renewable energy and to tap their vast fossil fuel resources with less pollution. The technology is not cost-effective now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;How we produce and use energy is fundamental to our economic recovery, but also our security and our planet. And we know that we can't afford to tackle these issues in isolation,&quot; Obama said, adding there was &quot;no silver bullet&quot; solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOING FURTHER ON CLIMATE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists want Obama to go further and pressure Canada to clean up its oil sands in the western province of Alberta, from which oil is extracted in a process that spews out large amounts of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tar sands create three times the global warming pollution as conventional oil and are not a viable alternative, no matter how the Canadian government and oil industry portray it,&quot; said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz of the International Program Natural Resources Defense Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with his country facing its worst economic crisis in decades, Obama stressed the importance of Canada as the United States' largest energy provider. Most of the output of the oil sands is destined for U.S. markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the agreement to stimulate the development of green energy, Harper said it was too early for the countries to talk about a shared strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama, who took office last month, campaigned on a pledge to reduce U.S. emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to a passive approach by his predecessor, George W. Bush, Obama is committed to tackling global warming, but he said climate change initiatives must be balanced against economic considerations in the midst of a worldwide recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A White House official said the joint U.S.-Canadian green energy initiative would work on &quot;elements like carbon capture and sequestration and the smart grid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for warming the Earth. Carbon sequestration, which is not yet commercially viable, involves capturing the gas and storing it underground before it enters the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Afghanistan, where Canada has 2,700 troops as part of a NATO-led force fighting a growing insurgency, Obama said he had not asked for more military help. Obama ordered 17,000 new U.S. troops there this week to battle the insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harper said Ottawa, which plans to withdraw its troops in 2011, would expand economic aid to Afghanistan, already Canada's biggest foreign recipient of aid.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's attorney general's office said on Thursday it had not seized a private plane registered to Allen Stanford, after media reported an aircraft belonging to the Texas billionaire accused of massive fraud was detained in a U.S. drug money laundering probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no criminal investigation in Mexico into Stanford, who was found by the FBI in Virginia and served with court papers accusing him of an $8 billion fraud, said Octavio Campos, a spokesman for the attorney general's office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are no records of planes registered in his name,&quot; Campos, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing unnamed U.S. officials, ABC News earlier reported that Mexican authorities had detained one of Stanford's private planes, finding checks inside allegedly connected to the Gulf cartel, Mexico's most violent drug gang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campos said no plane in Stanford's name was seized in Mexico although investigators were still checking whether any other aircraft at all linked to the billionaire or his companies had been impounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Stanford and two Stanford Group Co executives of fraud, selling $8 billion in certificates of deposit that offered impossibly high returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banking regulators across Latin America are investigating local units of Stanford's bank and people are scrambling to rescue their savings as fallout from U.S. fraud charges against the tycoon spread from the United States and the Caribbean to Latin America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper did not bring up the issue of a Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr when they met on Thursday, a senior Canadian official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposition parties had urged Harper to ask Obama to repatriate Canadian-born Khadr, who is charged with murdering a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan in 2002 when he was 15. They say he should be treated as a child soldier. He is 22 now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harper's stance has been that the charges are too serious for him to intervene in the case. Obama is having to decide what to do with Khadr and other Guantanamo detainees since he has promised to shut down the prison camp at the U.S. military base in Cuba&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said the case did not arise during the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposition Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, however, raised it in a brief meeting with Obama at the end of his visit to Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The president thanked us for our concern, said they are reviewing all the cases, trying to figure out basically who the bad guys are,&quot; Ignatieff told CBC television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;He distinguished between Type 1, Type 2, Type 3. He did not indicate which category in which he was placing Mr. Khadr, but was glad to know that a Canadian party's concerned about Mr. Khadr.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA (Reuters) - Declaring &quot;I love this country&quot; and waving to ecstatic Canadian crowds, U.S. President Barack Obama helped reignite on Thursday a close binational friendship that had waned during the administration of his predecessor George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama revived a tradition whereby new U.S. presidents make their first foreign trip to Canada, which is one of America's most important trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush made his initial visit to Mexico after winning the 2000 election and subsequently grew ever more unpopular among Canadians, in particular over his decision to invade Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new U.S. leader, on the other hand, was treated like a rock star by the thousands of people who gathered in freezing temperatures to welcome him on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Bush, who rarely expressed much public enthusiasm for Canada, a close U.S. ally and its largest suppler of energy, Obama ladled on praise for its northern neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I love this country. We could not have a better friend and ally,&quot; Obama told a closing news conference with Prime Minister Stephen Harper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm looking forward to this being the start of a continued extraordinary relationship between our two countries.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama has a Canadian brother-in-law and two of his key staff members are from Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polls show he is much more popular among Canadians than their own prime minister, quite possibly because of his relaxed style and easy humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to also, by the way, thank some of the Canadians who came over the border to campaign for me during the election. It was much appreciated and I'm looking forward to coming back to Canada as soon as it warms up,&quot; he said to laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama even managed to start the news conference with a stumble -- declaring that &quot;it is a great pleasure to be here in Iow-, err, in Ottawa&quot; -- but no one seemed to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harper -- a rather stiff and formal figure -- referred to Obama as &quot;Mr. President&quot; yet seemed more comfortable than he had been with Bush, who raised eyebrows by calling him &quot;Steve&quot; after the two men first met in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics accused Harper's Conservative government of taking its orders from Bush, giving him another reason to keep his distance from the previous White House occupant. There are no such problems with Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Canada and the United States are ... closer friends than any two nations on the face of the earth,&quot; Harper said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Obama left Parliament Hill on his way back to the airport, his armored limousine made an impromptu visit to Ottawa's central Byward Market area where he bought some cookies, pausing afterward to wave to cheering bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sir Allen Who? Stanford not on Houston's radar</title>

<description><![CDATA[HOUSTON (Reuters) - Ask Houston residents what they know about Stanford Group Co, the privately held financial services firm accused of an $8 billion fraud by the U.S. government, and many mention oak trees.]]></description>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Ask Houston residents what they know about Stanford Group Co, the privately held financial services firm accused of an $8 billion fraud by the U.S. government, and many mention oak trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, the Houston company cut down six 20-foot tall oak trees to make way for landscaping and a fountain bearing the company's militaristic eagle and shield logo in front of its U.S. headquarters, even though local officials said the company had no right to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford's action sparked outrage from conservationists and civic groups and a wave of media coverage. Ten years later, the company with 500 workers here appears to have done little to mend fences in the nation's fourth largest city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen Stanford, 58, the fifth-generation Texan and billionaire accused of a &quot;massive ongoing fraud&quot; by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, does not spend much of his time or money in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although his financial empire has a global center on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands and his Stanford International Bank is based in Antigua, Stanford Group Co is based in Houston, and those were the offices that federal agents first swooped down on this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've never seen his name anywhere,&quot; said David Jones of Dini Partners, a fund-raising consultant for nonprofit organizations including Allen Stanford's alma mater Baylor University. &quot;And I don't see the firm showing up on donor lists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in sharp contrast to the high profile of Enron Corp, the infamous Houston-based energy company that collapsed in 2001. Former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay was a leader on the city's business and charity circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greater Houston Partnership, a local organization aimed at promoting business, sought to minimize Stanford's importance to the city's financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stanford has approximately 500 employees in Houston,&quot; spokeswoman Christina Garza wrote in an e-mail. &quot;That's 3/10 of one percent of all employees in the financial services/banking sector in Houston and less than 2/100 of one percent of all employees in the region.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford Executive Director Jay Comeaux, a polo lover, is the company's public face in Houston, attending charity functions and appearing as a bold-faced name in society columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIR ALLEN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has a quirky, insular culture. Employees are required to wear a lapel pin bearing the firm's ubiquitous eagle and shield logo. Company publications are peppered with devotional mentions of &quot;Sir Allen,&quot; a reference to the title given to him in 2006 by Antiguan authorities, not the Queen of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's two executive buildings are in the same Galleria neighborhood that is home to the city's high-end restaurants and luxury boutiques including Versace, Hermes, Chanel and Tiffany &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Stanford's visible presence in the area, the head of the neighborhood chamber group said he has no dealings with the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've never had any interaction with them,&quot; said John Breeding, Uptown Houston District President. &quot;They are not a significant player and are not involved in this area.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The squat headquarters building, set far back from a busy street, is lushly landscaped with palm trees and tropical flowers. Stanford has a 5-star corporate dining room, called the Eagle Room, used to woo potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Eagle Room remains my secret weapon,&quot; gushed one Stanford broker in a company publication highlighting the dining room's importance to the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the restaurant, the high-profile sporting events and art exhibits the company sponsors are ways for the firm to entertain their clients and win business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firm sponsors a number of golf, polo, cricket and sailing events. And each year it awards a prize to one employee who shows &quot;genuine virtuous leadership,&quot; a characteristic that workers are expected to exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We strive to recognize excellence in achievement, as reflected in our deep commitment to sports and in the annual recognition of a Stanford employee who personifies excellence,&quot; the company wrote on its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford does give to some pet causes in Houston. For example from 2004 to 2008, Stanford was a sponsor of Latin American and Asian Art at the city's Museum of Fine Arts. A spokeswoman for the museum described the firm as a &quot;mid-level&quot; donor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Latin America is a key market for Stanford Financial Group,&quot; Allen Stanford wrote on his website, wwww.allenstanford.com. &quot;As a company whose North American headquarters is in Houston with a significant number of Hispanic employees, the firm sees the importance of showcasing this part of Stanford Financial Group's culture to the Houston community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the relationship between Stanford and the museum ended in June, the museum said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>At small Antigua accounting firm: Who's Stanford?</title>

<description><![CDATA[ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (Reuters) - C.A.S. Hewlett &amp; Co, the small Antiguan firm that Texas billionaire Allen Stanford identified as the auditors of his offshore bank, said on Thursday it had no information about ties to the tycoon accused of fraud.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51I5XK20090219</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jason Szep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (Reuters) - C.A.S. Hewlett &amp;amp; Co, the small Antiguan firm that Texas billionaire Allen Stanford identified as the auditors of his offshore bank, said on Thursday it had no information about ties to the tycoon accused of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;St. John's-based Hewlett has been identified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the auditors of Stanford's $8 billion offshore bank, but executives there provided little indication they even knew who Stanford was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current manager, Eugene Perry, at C.A.S. Hewlett in the Antiguan capital, said Thursday the firm's former chief executive, Charlesworth &quot;Shelley&quot; Hewlett, is the only person with possible knowledge of a relationship to Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But getting any information from Shelley Hewlett is not likely. He died January 1 at age 73.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perry said he never met Stanford in his 10 years working at the firm. He spoke with a Reuters reporter in the late Hewlett's personal office and telephoned a woman he identified as the company's principal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are not privy to any information about any relationship with Stanford,&quot; said the woman, who would only identify herself as Celia. Asked if she was aware of any files at the firm associated with Stanford, she said she was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hewlett's daughter, named Celia, took over responsibility for the accounting firm from London after her father died. It couldn't be determined if the Celia interviewed by telephone was the late Hewlett's daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the SEC accused Stanford, a brash, 58-year-old financier and sports entrepreneur, of operating an $8 billion fraud centered on the sale of high-yielding certificates of deposit offered by Stanford International Bank Ltd (SIB), his Antiguan affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest in Stanford has extended across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain's Serious Fraud Office said Thursday it was monitoring a possible link between the accounting firm and Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a situation where there is the possibility there may be a U.K. link, and so we are monitoring the situation,&quot; a spokesman for the SFO said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not the case that we have launched investigators at it. We are making contact and liaising with other authorities,&quot; the spokesman added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.A.S. Hewlett has offices at several London addresses, but the phone numbers were either disconnected, or rang unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two people with neighboring businesses in Enfield, a residential suburb north of London, told Reuters that C.A.S. Hewlett had had a small office in the building on Southbury Road, but that the employees left about four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANYBODY HOME?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEC said in its court complaint that it had tried several times to contact C.A.S. Hewlett during its investigation, but &quot;no one ever answered the phone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIB'S midyear report, released in June, identified C.A.S. Hewlett as its auditors. The SEC also listed the firm as Stanford's auditor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the 10 workers in the Hewlett office in a quiet, largely residential neighborhood in the capital, seemed an unlikely operation to manage books for an $8 billion enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During two visits over two days by Reuters reporters, no one staffed a reception desk in the aquamarine building. On one visit to the reception area that lasted nearly two hours, there was no senior manager in the building. The occasional sound of reggae music wafted from inside the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.A.S. Hewlett is listed on the British Commonwealth's website as a &quot;financial services partner&quot; in Antigua with an offshore client portfolio that includes banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions and intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlesworth Hewlett was born in 1936, according to the website, and qualified as an accountant in 1970 after attending South West London College. He also is said to have served in the Britain's Royal Air Force and earned a medal for active service in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Lucia Mutikani&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers drawing unemployment aid jumped to a record high of nearly 5 million, the government said on Thursday, as a worsening economy made it increasingly hard to find jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data from early February suggested the 13-month-old U.S. recession was deepening, a conclusion supported by a report that showed factory activity in the country's Mid-Atlantic region contracted sharply in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The data indicates an accelerated deterioration ... jobs are being lost and the pool of unemployed is growing faster,&quot; said Kevin Logan, senior U.S. economist at Dresdner Kleinwort in New York. &quot;People cannot find jobs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell as the data reinforced fears the worsening slump would erode company profits, driving the Dow Jones industrial average to 7,465.95, its lowest close since October 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worries about more heavy borrowing to fund the government's efforts to rescue the economy hammered Treasury debt prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of unemployed still on the benefits rolls after drawing an initial week of aid surged 170,000 to 4.99 million in the week ended February 7, the Labor Department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the highest reading on records dating to 1967 and it took the insured jobless rate to 3.7 percent, the highest since 1983, when the economy was emerging from a 16-month recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New applications for unemployment benefits were steady at 627,000 last week, hovering close to a 26-year high and raising the possibility that job losses in the non-farm sector could cross the 600,000 threshold in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Wieting, an economist at Citigroup in New York, said the data was &quot;consistent with a very quick sharp rise in the unemployment rate and that's going to continue for the next few months because production data are correcting very sharply.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A researcher at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank said in a newsletter that U.S. employment would likely have dropped by about 4 percent by the time the recession ends, which would mark the steepest fall in 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aggressive layoffs and the accompanying insecurity over jobs could lead households, whose net worth has already been eroded by the collapse of the housing and stock markets, to cut spending further, creating a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington has put forward an array of measures, including a $787 billion stimulus package, in the hopes of reviving the weakening economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORDERS PLUMMET&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index, which gauges factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region, dropped to minus 41.3 in February from a negative 24.3 the prior month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New orders plummeted and the survey's jobs gauge hit its lowest level since the series started in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The data provides confirmation that the sharply negative growth rate is not showing signs of turning around,&quot; said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. &quot;On the contrary, it may have turned even a little more negative than the breathtaking collapse witnessed in October-November.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate report, the Labor Department said prices received by U.S. farms, factories and refineries rose 0.8 percent in January, the first advance since July as energy prices rebounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the producer price index was down 1 percent from its year-ago level, the largest drop since October 2006. Core prices, which exclude food and energy costs, rose 0.4 percent last month, accelerating from December's 0.2 percent rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts said last month's producer price gain may have reflected seasonal factors and dismissed it as a signal that inflation pressures were suddenly picking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just about every other measure of inflation that we have seen is showing restrained readings. I don't think it's signaling anything troublesome,&quot; said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An index from the private-sector Conference Board meant to forecast where the economy is heading rose 0.4 percent in January, the second straight monthly gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts, however, said the so-called index of leading indicators had been inflated by a rise in money supply as the Federal Reserve pumped billions of dollars into the economy to try to combat the recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's not a sign of good things to come. That's a sign of fear and contraction,&quot; said Dresdner Kleinwort's Logan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region crashed to an 18-year low in February, underperforming economists' worst expectations as the year-old recession continued to exact a heavy toll on manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank reported on Thursday that its business activity index tumbled to minus 41.3 from negative 24.3 in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is grim,&quot; said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any number below zero indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deterioration was led by falling new orders and unemployment, with the survey's jobs gauge hitting its lowest since the survey's launch in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wall Street, stocks cut their gains after the surprisingly weak report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government bonds, which generally benefit from weak data, were lower on the day, but mainly because investors were worried about the enormous borrowing the Treasury will need to do to pay for its economic recovery efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News in the report of bloated inventories suggested tough slogging ahead for companies, as this can mean they must sell off stockpiled goods before they can consider increasing production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In special questions this month, firms were asked about their current inventory situation. Nearly 44 percent indicated inventories were too high and were expected to decrease during the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was any silver lining to the report it was the gauge of six-month business conditions, which rose to 15.9 from 7.4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given the dismal state of the economy -- and manufacturing in particular -- economists are likely to await actual improvement in conditions before adopting a more optimistic view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists had expected a result of minus 25.0, according to the median of 47 forecasts in a Reuters poll, which ranged from minus 34.0 to negative 20.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey of factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers continuing to claim jobless benefits jumped to a record high in the first week of February, the Labor Department data showed on Thursday, while new claims for unemployment insurance were unchanged at a very high level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. producer prices rose faster than expected in January after falling for five straight months as energy costs rebounded, government data showed on Thursday, but inflation pressures generally remained benign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KEY POINTS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOBLESS CLAIMS: * The number of people remaining on the benefits rolls after drawing an initial week of aid surged 170,000 to 4.987 million in the week ended Feb 7, the most recent week for which the data is available. That was the highest reading on records dating back to 1967. * Analysts had estimated so-called continued claims would be 4.86 million from a previously reported 4.81 million the prior week. * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits were a seasonally adjusted 627,000 in the week ended February 14 unchanged from an upwardly revised 627,000 the previous week. * New claims hovered close to a 26-year high. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 620,000 new claims versus a previously reported figure of 623,000 the week before. * The four-week moving average of new jobless claims, a better gauge of underlying labor trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose to 619,000, the highest since 1982, from 608,500 the prior week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPI: * The Labor Department said the producer price index rose 0.8 percent in January, rising for the first-time since July, compared to a 1.9 percent drop in December. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.2 percent rise in the overall index. * Compared to the same period last year, the producer price index fell 1 percent, the largest decline since October 2006. * Core producer prices, excluding food and energy costs, rose 0.4 percent in January, also above market expectations for an increase of 0.1 percent. * Core PPI rose 0.2 percent in December. * Compared to the same period a year ago, core producer prices were up 4.2 percent. * Energy prices surged 3.7 percent in January, halting five months of declines. Gasoline prices jumped 15 percent, the biggest increase since November 2007. * Food prices fell 0.4 percent, with declines in diary and meat costs more than offsetting sharp increases in vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHAD MORGANLANDER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp;amp; CO, FLORHAM PARK, NEW JERSEY:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOBLESS CLAIMS:&quot;The persistent trend in job losses will have a negative feedback loop in the economy. On a short-term basis, you might get a relief rally predicated on the fact that we're oversold. Long term, I'm concerned about economic trends which have deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Consensus views on economic growth in 2009 have to be revised downward.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPI: &quot;There's a lot of white noise in those numbers. It's difficult to determine a trend. We think we're in a deflationary period and we would certainly keep an eye on deflation. That's the main concern in 2009 and 2010.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONRAD DEQUADROS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RDQ ECONOMICS, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Obviously another very weak reading on the labor market though that's not a particular surprise. If we look at the trend in jobless claims between the January and February employment survey periods it suggests perhaps a significantly larger decline in payrolls for February than we saw in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think we would be looking at a decline perhaps well north of 600,000 on payrolls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALAN LEVENSON, CHIEF ECONOMIST, T. ROWE PRICE, BALTIMORE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're maintaining a high level of labor market deterioration in February and we're likely to see another 500,000 to 600,000 jobs lost when we see the employment data in a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't think the data was really unexpected. Elevated jobless claims aren't a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're seeing some stabilization, in terms of the growth rate not getting worse. It's like saying someone's fever has stabilized at 105 degrees. It's stable, but they're not a healthy person. You can say the same thing with production, we stabilized at declines of 2.5 percent, but evidence of that is preliminary. In general I think we're moving toward the pace of maximum contraction in the economy, but evidence for that is only preliminary.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're now seeing the effects of the layoffs that were announced earlier in the year that made a lot of headlines, those people are now in fact being laid off and filing for their claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Back in '82 we had a stretch of 13 weeks where we had claims in excess of 600,000. The labor force was 40 percent smaller then, though. If the job market was as comparably bad as it was in '82, these numbers would have to be running consistently around 900,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Unemployment rate) &quot;We've always been coming up just shy of 10 percent (in our models). To the extent there's a transitory benefit of the fiscal stimulus, that makes it less likely we get to it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MORGAN STANLEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't think jobless claims provides any new insight into what is going on in the state of the nation's economy. Labor markets will continue to deteriorate right through mid-year if not even further. We will continue to see claims struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The PPI report is more a reflection of the fact that we are not seeing the same declines in energy prices as we were in the fall months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wouldn't get excited about core being up 0.4 percent as a sign of stagflation. I think there are some anomalies and that we will be in a deflationary environment for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Treasuries are essentially unchanged. Once again we are back to supply.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KATHY LIEN, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY RESEARCH, GFT, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have mixed numbers this morning with inflation stronger than expected but jobless claims and continuing claims still at high levels. What I am worried about is the continuing claims number, because they are just a whisker away from five million Americans having lost their jobs. As for PPI the uptick was foreshadowed by the smaller decline in import prices and despite the rise it won't draw away from the disinflation fears of the Federal Reserve. Not too much action in the dollar following the numbers because they are mixed. The jobs data offsets the surprise inflation data.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures pare gains after jobless claims. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices hold losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds losses versus major rivals.&lt;/p&gt;</media:text>

<title>SF Fed economist sees worst job losses in 50 years</title>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Ros Krasny&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Job losses in the current U.S. recession are likely to be the worst in 50 years, but fiscal stimulus will provide some relief, according to an economist at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of January 2009, employment had fallen by 2.6 percent from the December 2007 business-cycle peak, still less than the roughly 3-percent decline seen during the 1981-82 recession, research adviser Sylvain Leduc wrote in the bank's latest &quot;FedViews&quot; newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the recession, &quot;employment should have decreased by roughly 4 percent from December 2007. We have to go back to the 1957-58 recession to see a larger percentage drop in employment,&quot; Leduc said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bleak assessment came as the U.S. Labor Department showed initial jobless claims at 627,000 for the week ended Feb 14. Continued claims for the week ended February 7 were a record 4.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leduc forecast that U.S. real GDP would turn positive in the second half of 2009 on the back of Obama administration's $787 billion economic stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The fiscal stimulus package has a sizable impact on our growth forecast, particularly in 2009. Moreover, we forecast that the unemployment rate would climb to nearly 10 percent, absent the fiscal initiative,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real GDP for 2009 will likely be minus 1 percent, according to the bank's forecasting staff. Without the stimulus program 2009, GDP was forecast to fall 2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth-quarter 2009 jobless rate was pegged at 8.9 percent, falling to 8.5 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010. Without fiscal stimulus, the rate in both instances was forecast at 9.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leduc said the inflation rate should stabilize &quot;at a very low level&quot; after plunging in the fourth quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Fed's forecasters expect the core personal consumption expenditures index, a measure of inflation, to rise slightly from the 0.5 percent annual rate hit in the fourth quarter, and remain at about 0.75 percent throughout 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Fed officials recently have noted that even if outright deflation does not occur, very low inflation will push up &quot;real&quot; interest rates at the worst possible time for the struggling economy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. judge rules Spitzer documents be unsealed</title>

<media:content url="http://www.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20090219&amp;t=2&amp;i=8329885&amp;w="  type="image/jpeg"  expression="full"  medium="image" ></media:content>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge ordered the unsealing of documents in an investigation that linked former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer to a prostitution ring, potentially shedding more light on a scandal that forced Spitzer to resign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday's ruling was a result of a request by The New York Times to unseal documents that outlined the prosecutors' probable cause for wiretapping two cell phones belonging to the prostitution ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Jed Rakoff ruled on Thursday that the public's right to know about an investigation that led to the resignation of the governor outweighed any privacy concerns, especially since the names of other clients were to be redacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials to be unsealed were affidavits and other documents that prosecutors filed in support of their request to wiretap. They must be released by Tuesday, the judge said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do not include transcripts or recordings of any conversations, said David McCraw, a lawyer for The Times. The newspaper had asked for everything in the file and was told the wiretaps did not produce any material that warranted going in the file, McCraw said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spitzer was forced to resign last March shortly after The Times reported he was a client of the prostitution ring under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resignation of the Democratic governor rocked Washington and Wall Street, where Spitzer had created enemies through his aggressive investigation of fraud cases in his previous post as attorney general of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spitzer was never charged with a crime. Four organizers of the ring were charged and pleaded guilty, putting an end to the criminal case.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Obama catches the travel bug early</title>

<description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If this is Thursday, it must be Ottawa for U.S. President Barack Obama.]]></description>
<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51I57J20090219</guid>
<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Steve Holland - Analysis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If this is Thursday, it must be Ottawa for U.S. President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He traveled around the United States for most of two years to win the White House. Now that he has been living there for a month, he has caught the travel bug again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week he campaigned for the $787 billion economic stimulus bill by traveling four days in a row, taking Air Force One to Indiana, Florida, Virginia and Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he spent a long holiday weekend in his hometown of Chicago and this week he has visited Denver, Colorado, and Phoenix and Mesa in Arizona. On Thursday he went on his first foreign trip, to the Canadian capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama, whose approval rating is more than 60 percent, is drawing big crowds and reveling in the attention, with the cheering throngs a welcome change from Washington, where the next partisan battle is never far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did not take long for Obama to complain about feeling constricted after he won the November 4 election, cut off from regular people by the massive security bubble that surrounds him wherever he goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;He believes there's a lot of benefit to getting out of Washington at least once a week and meeting with and seeing the problems that Americans are dealing with,&quot; said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DIRECT TO THE PUBLIC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White House veterans said traveling around the country allows the president to take his case to the people who elected him and escape Washington, which many Americans consider out of touch with their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The White House can be a very confining place,&quot; said Jeff Eller, who worked for President Bill Clinton. &quot;It's always good to get out and literally see other parts of the country, touch people and listen to them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when he was a senator from Illinois, Obama could easily walk around his Chicago neighborhood to get coffee or see friends. Now any such movement is a major production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry Truman once referred to the White House as the &quot;great white jail&quot; -- and indeed it can seem that way sometimes. The grounds of the mansion are surrounded by a tall security fence and the living quarters are mostly confined to two floors of the six-level complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think for any president, the first thing they regret is the loss of their common touch and the feel of losing that common touch with everyday Americans, so they're always looking for ways to keep connected,&quot; said Trent Duffy, who worked for President George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama fought and won a battle to hang on to his BlackBerry device to overcome layers of bureaucracy and stay in touch with top staff and a close coterie of friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told CNBC in January he was looking for unscripted ways to interact with people -- &quot;ways that aren't controlled, ways where, you know, people aren't just complimenting you or standing up when you enter into a room, ways of staying grounded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERMANENT CAMPAIGN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By signing the economic stimulus bill in Denver, Obama was following a time-honored tradition of presidents making news outside of the U.S. capital. Appearances outside of Washington can get greater media attention, make the president seem above the political fray and allow him to push his message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may well be a political element to his travels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the states he has visited recently are ones that for years voted Republican in presidential elections but went for Obama the Democrat this time. He would certainly hope they go for him again, assuming he runs for re-election in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presidential scholar Stephen Hess, a political science professor at George Washington University, said that &quot;in a sense we are in the era of the permanent campaign.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said presidents can learn what is on the minds of people when they travel, such as when John Kennedy heard a roar of approval from a crowd when he talked up the possibility of a nuclear-test ban treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you're here in Washington, how do you get your information? You get it sort of tabulated for you. 'Here's what your pollsters are telling you,'&quot; Hess said. &quot;It's only when you go out there when you can put some meat on these bones.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government sued UBS AG on Thursday, seeking disclosure to the Internal Revenue Service of thousands of the Swiss bank's U.S. customers with secret accounts, the Justice Department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed in federal court in Miami came the day after UBS agreed to pay $780 million and identify certain U.S. clients in a deal to resolve criminal fraud charges that it assisted rich Americans to evade taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action came after U.S. tax authorities said a request for the records under a Swiss treaty may only result in the production of records for about 300 accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit, as many as 52,000 U.S. customers hid their UBS accounts from the government in violation of tax laws, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government said in the suit that of those 52,000 secret accounts, about 20,000 contained securities and about 32,000 contained cash. According to a UBS document filed with the lawsuit, as of the mid-2000s, those secret accounts held about $14.8 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to court documents, U.S. citizens failed to report and pay U.S. income taxes on income earned in those secret accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit also alleged that UBS helped hundreds of U.S. taxpayers set up dummy offshore companies, to make it easier for those taxpayers to avoid their reporting obligations under U.S. tax laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said, &quot;We are committed to moving forward with the summons enforcement process. This action sends a strong signal to taxpayers hiding their money offshore. The IRS will be aggressive in pursuing people who shirk their obligations under the tax law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Jim Christie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California lawmakers approved on Thursday a state budget package to close a $42 billion deficit, ending a lengthy standoff with a slate of bills that aim to raise taxes, slash spending and increase borrowing with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both houses of the Democrat-led legislature passed the package and Schwarzenegger, a Republican, is eager to sign it. &quot;Certainly as soon as we can,&quot; said spokesman Aaron McLear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early morning votes for the 18-month spending plan ended an impasse in the legislature of more than 100 days over balancing California's books during which the state's economy weakened significantly and substantially cut its revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package provides for $15 billion in spending cuts, $12.8 billion in tax increases and $11.4 billion in borrowing. It also creates a $1 billion reserve for fiscal 2009 to 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assembly Speaker Karen Bass said those basic points, bitterly contested between Democrats opposed to spending cuts and anti-tax Republicans, would prevent the government of the most populous state from falling off a financial cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We may have taken a rocky ride down the side of that cliff, but the state is intact and ready to get in gear for recovery,&quot; Bass said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JUST IN TIME&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial woes besieging California had become so severe state officials had braced for the state's cash account to be depleted this month if a budget was not passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard &amp;amp; Poor's Ratings Services this month cut California's general obligation bond rating to the lowest of any U.S. state, a rebuke and warning to the biggest issuer of U.S. public debt that its borrowing costs could jump if it did not close its massive shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials in the state capital of Sacramento in recent weeks scrambled to bolster the state's finances amid an unprecedented revenue crisis, the result of Wall Street's meltdown, rising unemployment, a sharp pullback in consumer spending and the long housing downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They clamped down on spending by putting public works projects on hold, withholding payments to counties for social services and postponing tax refunds, and this week Schwarzenegger told state departments to send layoff warning notices to 20,000 state employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, lawmakers were made fully aware federal stimulus money was at risk if the state's finances remained in doubt, adding pressure to pass the budget package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It just got to the point where they just had no choice,&quot; said Larry Gerston, a San Jose State University political scientist. &quot;It just became so unbearable that the most principled or stubborn people, you can take your pick, had to think about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PIVOTAL VOTE SECURED&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwarzenegger and top lawmakers from both parties agreed on the budget package late last week and the legislature held marathon sessions over the long Presidents Day holiday weekend to debate it. The package had enough votes in the Assembly to pass but was one Republican vote short in the state Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether Senate President Darrell Steinberg would win that single vote was thrown into doubt on Wednesday after the chamber's Republican caucus turned on Sen. Dave Cogdill, who as their leader had negotiated the budget package, and replaced him with anti-tax hard-liner Sen. Dennis Hollingsworth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Sen. Abel Maldonado provided the pivotal Republican vote in exchange for support from Democrats for altering the budget package's tax plans, including dropping a proposed hike of 12 cents a gallon to the state's gasoline tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maldonado also secured support from Democrats for bills to suspend pay increases for lawmakers when the state's finances falter and for a ballot measure proposing open primaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns and hard feelings mixed with relief that a spending plan would soon be signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said the package may prove to be only a short-term fix for the state's finances: &quot;It was the triumph of exhaustion over deliberation ... The only thing worse than the budget is continued stalemate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who is running for the Republican nomination to succeed Schwarzenegger, predicted the package would worsen future state budget deficits. &quot;The budget that was passed by the state legislature is not the solution,&quot; she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assemblywoman Julie Brownley, a Democrat, said the package was a &quot;monstrosity&quot; and denounced the legislature's Republican minority for dictating terms &quot;repugnant to a majority elected by the populace.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange County Supervisor John Moorlach said tax increases would harm the state's economy: &quot;The last time we pulled something like this we saw the U-Haul index change, with a lot of people moving out of the state.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Whalen, a Hoover Institution fellow and former aide to former California Gov. Pete Wilson, noted the package's plan for selling debt backed by state lottery revenues relies on voter approval, requiring Democrats and Republicans to campaign together. &quot;The question will be how much bipartisanship will be on display for the voters,&quot; Whalen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BISHKEK (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan's parliament voted on Thursday to close the last remaining U.S. air base in Central Asia, dealing a blow to U.S. efforts to use the region as a jumping-off point for its growing campaign in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is sending an extra 17,000 troops to Afghanistan and was seeking support from its allies at a NATO meeting in Poland for more help in defeating the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense Secretary Robert Gates said before the meeting in Krakow that, &quot;there clearly will be expectations that the allies must do more as well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama has made the campaign in Afghanistan his top foreign policy priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But U.S. efforts to diversify supply routes into Afghanistan after supply convoys were attacked by militants in Pakistan hit a stumbling block when Kyrgyzstan said it would close the last remaining U.S. air base in Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyzstan's parliament backed a decision by President Kurmanbek Bakiyev -- announced in Moscow after he secured a $2 billion package of aid and credit from Russia -- to close the Manas air base 35 km (22 miles) from the capital Bishkek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Kadyrbek Sarbayev said Washington would be given 180 days to wrap up operations after the parliamentary decision was signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies fly troops and supplies from bases in Europe and the Gulf and could increase this traffic to make up for the loss of Manas air base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the closure underlined the challenges Washington faces in enlisting Russian support for its campaign in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia says it is willing to help with the shipment of supplies through former Soviet Central Asian states, but is expected to resist any attempt by Washington to build a permanent military presence there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first shipment of non-military goods is expected to leave NATO member Latvia shortly, going through Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HEAVY COMMITMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is bracing itself for a major challenge in Afghanistan, with the Taliban insurgency growing in strength both there and in neighboring Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Army General David McKiernan told reporters in Washington that 2009 would be a tough year, but the extra troops would help break a stalemate in southern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he said it would be a long struggle. &quot;For the next three to four years, I think we're going to need to stay heavily committed ... in a sustained manner in Afghanistan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reinforcements will take U.S. troop numbers to around 55,000, in addition to the 30,000 troops from 40 other mostly NATO countries already operating in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the extra troops will be sent to southern Afghanistan where mostly British, Canadian and Dutch troops have not had enough soldiers to keep effective control of ground they have captured from the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gates acknowledged that large increases in troops from Washington's NATO allies were unlikely but said he would also seek more help on civilian development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;There needs to be a strengthening on the civilian side as we are strengthening on the military side. And frankly I hope it may be easier for our allies to do that than significant troop increases especially for the longer term.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer also said NATO needed to stop looking at Afghanistan in isolation and recognize Taliban militants were also fighting to destabilize Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can say again that I believe the Pakistani government is serious about fighting extremism. What we need in NATO is to stop seeing Afghanistan in isolation and to start seeing it in a more regional approach.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than seven years after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan to topple the Taliban following the 9/11 attacks on the United States, the Islamist insurgency has spread from Pakistan's border with Afghanistan deeper into the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the Pakistan government stuck a peace deal to end fighting between the Taliban and the Pakistan Army in the Swat valley, just 130 km (90 miles) north of Islamabad, by promising to reintroduce Islamic sharia law there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BISHKEK (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan's parliament voted on Thursday to close the only U.S. air base in Central Asia, removing one of the U.S. military's supply routes into Afghanistan as it prepares to send more troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also faced reluctance from its NATO allies to provide more soldiers to complement the extra 17,000 troops it is sending to Afghanistan to tackle the Taliban insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense Secretary Robert Gates, attending a NATO meeting in Poland, said Washington wanted its allies to send more troops to provide security for a presidential election in Afghanistan in August but acknowledged big increases were unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyzstan's decision to close the U.S. air base undermined its plans to diversify supply routes into Afghanistan after supply convoys were attacked by militants in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyzstan's parliament backed a decision by President Kurmanbek Bakiyev -- announced in Moscow after he secured a $2 billion package of aid and credit from Russia -- to close the Manas air base 35 km (22 miles) from the capital Bishkek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Kadyrbek Sarbayev said Washington would be given 180 days to wrap up operations after the parliamentary decision was signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Washington the Pentagon said it was still looking at what it could offer Kyrgyzstan to keep the base open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We continue to consider what we might be able to offer the government but we're not prepared to stay at any price and we continue to look at other options that are available to us,&quot; Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO spokesman James Appathurai said NATO members would continue to supply their forces as needed. &quot;We have full stock piles ... it is an inconvenience for allies and one to regret, but we can certainly absorb it,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies fly troops and supplies from bases in Europe and the Gulf and could increase this traffic to make up for the loss of Manas air base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the closure underlined the challenges Washington faces in enlisting Russian support for its campaign in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Swiss bank secrecy under threat after UBS tax deal</title>

<guid isPermaLink="false" >USTRE51I1L720090219</guid>

<media:text type="html"  lang="en" >&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Jucca and Jonathan Lynn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZURICH/BERNE (Reuters) - Switzerland fought on Thursday to defend a landmark decision allowing bank giant UBS to transfer client data to the United States in a tax settlement that experts say will dilute bank secrecy laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS, the world's biggest bank to the rich, agreed late on Wednesday to pay a hefty $780 million fine and disclose the identity of some clients after U.S. investigators accused it of helping wealthy Americans to dodge taxes. The deal had the blessing of the government and the financial regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts say the settlement, a new step in the growing global fight against tax evasion, opens cracks in the country's tough bank secrecy laws and could potentially undermine $7-trillion global offshore banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss newspapers said the U.S. authorities had cracked Swiss bank secrecy, accusing the government of &quot;capitulating.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;For Switzerland, (the settlement) is a true catastrophe for the country's first industry, that is to say the banking sector,&quot; Geneva lawyer Charles Poncet, a former member of the Swiss parliament, told Radio Suisse Romande.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz, also Swiss president under a system which rotates the position each year, said the government had no choice but to let UBS settle the case to avoid criminal charges which could have threatened its existence and undermined Switzerland's economy. UBS and its rival Credit Suisse's combined liabilities are equivalent to about seven times Switzerland's gross domestic product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It became evident that if the American authorities would bring UBS to an indictment ... the whole threat would have been falling also on our economy,&quot; Merz told journalists, but added that Swiss bank secrecy remained in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The probe had added to uncertainties hanging over UBS, which has written down more toxic assets than any other European bank during the credit crisis and suffered billions of dollars in client withdrawals. Shares in UBS rose after news of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switzerland does not consider tax evasion a crime, and Swiss law prohibits disclosure of client data or names unless the country's authorities believe the client has committed a serious crime such as money laundering or tax fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Merz and UBS Chairman Peter Kurer said on Thursday the data exchange concerned solely cases of tax fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We tolerated a company culture which did not respect foreign laws,&quot; Kurer admitted on television on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the unprecedented step in this case was that the data was handed over before a Swiss administrative court had the chance to say whether any fraud had been committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The agreement between UBS and the U.S. department of justice raises serious questions about the rule of law,&quot; Swiss business group Economiesuisse said. &quot;It is irritating that among friendly states the legal ways are bypassed by the U.S.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOVE Toward TRANSPARENCY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis is adding pressure on offshore centers like Switzerland, which alone manages one third of the world's undeclared wealth, to stop helping clients hide their money from the taxman as governments seek funds to pay for more spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of wealthy westerners avoid taxes by hiding assets in Switzerland and other offshore centers, and U.S. lawmakers say tax havens deprive Washington of $100 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UBS tax settlement could set a precedent for similar deals with other banks or by other jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We highlight that any success by the US tax authority could encourage tax authorities in other jurisdictions to pursue a similar strategy,&quot; Merrill Lynch analysts said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany has said it wants Switzerland put on a tax haven blacklist and launched a probe last year into its nationals stashing assets in Liechtenstein. The German Finance Ministry said it had taken note of the UBS deal but had no more comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barak Obama also wants to get tough on tax havens and helped introduce a Senate bill in 2007 to this end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld, who once smuggled a client's diamonds into the United States in toothpaste, said he and other UBS bankers helped the bank earn $200 million a year managing $20 billion in assets held in offshore tax havens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POSITIVE FOR UBS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS's $780 million fine was lower than some media reports had predicted and its shares rose 4.7 percent to 12.79 francs by 9:55 a.m. EST, outperforming the DJ index of European bank stocks, which was up 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vontobel analysts said in a note: &quot;It is very positive for UBS to have closed off the case now as it will enable them to move forwards again and to start build up its reputation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS said it will book the settlement charge in its 2008 accounts, which will be published in an audited form in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials described the agreement as one of the biggest tax settlements ever, although smaller than media reports suggesting the fine could be up to 2 billion Swiss francs ($1.7 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The settlement was the most prominent for UBS since it and domestic rival Credit Suisse paid $1.25 billion after failing to return wealth to relatives of Holocaust victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss financial regulator FINMA, which played a key role in the settlement, said UBS had to hand over a limited quantity of client data to avert criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Such charges could have had drastic consequences for UBS and its liquidity situation and ultimately put its existence at risk,&quot; the authority said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss media say UBS turned over 250 client names out of an estimated 17,000 U.S. clients who concealed their identities and the existence of their accounts and hold $20 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement settles the criminal investigations against the bank but not a civil case by IRS, the U.S. tax collector. The IRS is seeking the names of thousands of UBS clients.&lt;/p&gt;
